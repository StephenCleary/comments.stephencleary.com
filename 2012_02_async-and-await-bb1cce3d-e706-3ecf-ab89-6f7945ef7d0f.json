So the ApiWrapper.GetSomething and BusinessLayer.GetSomething will complete on a thread pool thread (discarding the context), but MyController.Go will complete on the original ASP.NET context.  \r\n\r\n(There are various optimizations in place so that what actually happens is that when the last await completes in ApiWrapper.GetSomething, it will run on a thread pool thread which also finishes BusinessLayer.GetSomething and then enters the ASP.NET request context and finishes MyController.Go all on the same thread - but this is just an optimization detail).  \r\n\r\nI have an MSDN article online ([http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj991977.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj991977.aspx)) that goes into more detail around the best practices, but to summarize the guideline is to use ConfigureAwait(false) unless you know that you *do* need the context.

As you point out, the bottom line is that it doesn't even really make any sense to try to do what I was trying to do (because all I essentially accomplished in my 2nd solution was just moving the blocking call to a thread pool thread). IOW, it really is the case that to have an overall architecture in which asynchronicity is being sensibly utilized, the participating units of work, so to speak, need to be operations with async implementations. So starting at the beginning again, what I would really want to do is to supply an async implementation of the clsSlowOperation, instead of trying to \"wrap\" it up somehow.

I hope you get what I'm driving at with the following example. So I start with one regular (no async stuff involved in it) method A which calls another method B. Inside method B there is an instantiation of a web service which returns an int returnCode value. The web service takes a long time (up to 30 seconds) to execute. So hearing about this spiffy new async stuff in C# I thought, great. I can leave the web service completely alone (i.e., not touch its implementation), and just \"wrap\" the call to method B inside a method C, where method C is an async method. Only, this is evidently not possible because WHATEVER operation you put the \"await\" keyword in front of (in this example the call to the web service's method), HAS TO ALREADY HAVE AN ASYNC IMPLEMENTATION. So, for existing codebases where you have some long-running operations whose implementations you have to or want to leave alone (instead of changing them to async implementations or adding an async implementation of it), you can't just easily \"wrap\" async around them. Or am I missing something? Here is the actual code of my console app:\r\n\r\nnamespace AsyncWrapperMethodTest  \r\n{  \r\n public class Program  \r\n {  \r\n static void Main(string[] args)  \r\n {  \r\n clsMainlineStuff objMainLineStuff = new clsMainlineStuff();  \r\n objMainLineStuff.Operations();  \r\n }\r\n\r\n public class clsMainLineStuff  \r\n {  \r\n public void Operations()  \r\n {  \r\n clsLongRunningServiceAsync objLongRunningServiceAsync = new clsLongRunningServiceAsync();  \r\n var task = objLongRunningServiceAsync.RunAsync();\r\n\r\n // more code in Operations() that I don't want blocked...   \r\n }  \r\n }\r\n\r\n public class clsLongRunningServiceAsync  \r\n {  \r\n // This is the new method I added as a wrapper around pre-existing class clsLongRunningService.  \r\n public async Task<int> RunAsync()  \r\n {  \r\n clsLongRunningService objLongRunningService = new clsLongRunningService();  \r\n await objLongRunningService.DoLongRunningStuff(); // build error - Cannot await 'int'  \r\n return 0;  \r\n }  \r\n }\r\n\r\n public class clsLongRunningService  \r\n {  \r\n public int DoLongRunningStuff()  \r\n {  \r\n System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(30000); // here is where the web service call was being made  \r\n return 0; // say we got an int return code value back from the web service call, and are returning that value here  \r\n }  \r\n }\r\n\r\n }  \r\n}\r\n\r\nThe clsLongRunningService was the pre-existing class that inside its DoLongRunningStuff() method, a call to a pre-existing web service was being made, whose execution took a long time. Originally, the clsLongRunningService.DoLongRunningStuff() method was being called right from inside the clsMainLineStuff.Operations() method. So I just thought I could write a new class, clsLongRunningServiceAsync, \"wrapped\" around the clsLongRunningService.DoLongRunningStuff() invocation to prevent the blocking in clsMainLineStuff.Operations() from occurring. But as you can see, since the pre-existing clsLongRunningService.DoLongRunning() method returns an int, I get a \"Cannot await int\" build error on the l.o.c. in the clsLongRunningServiceAsync.RunAsync() method where I say \"await objLongRunningService.DoLongRunningStuff();\"\r\n\r\nIs there a way to get around this snafu that I'm not seeing, or is there just no way to accomplish what I am trying to accomplish? (And that, in other words, the new async/await/task stuff is great and all, but ultimately whatever operation you want to put an await keyword in front of, HAS to already return an object of type Task or you need to write a new implementation of it that does.)\r\n\r\nThanks for indulging me in my long-ish example :)","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"","date":"2015-01-04T04:39:51Z","timestamp":1420346391},{"_id":"d7570814-2c26-30db-92bd-9b1ee4c9d8f4","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"3db7b6e14d9da42751e4bab03bc4d034","authorUri":"https://stephencleary.com/","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"Task.Run should be a last resort; what you're actually doing is just moving the blocking call to a thread pool thread.\r\n\r\nIf this is a WCF service, you should be able to have Visual Studio auto-generate a proxy for you that has Task-returning methods.\r\n\r\nIf that isn't possible, then if the API you're using has any asynchronous capability (e.g., Begin/End methods, or an Async method with a Completed event, or even just custom callbacks), then you can wrap it into a Task-returning API (e.g., TaskFactory.FromAsync or TaskCompletionSource<t>).\r\n\r\nIf all you have is a synchronous API, then async/await isn't going to magically make it asynchronous for you.

I simplified the console app code, and I made the method to be executed be of void return type. This is because I initially had it returning an int, but it turns out that if you try to refer to the Task.Result int variable value even in the next line of code after invoking the task, the task will execute synchronously. Simply by not referring to the Task.Result int variable value, the task executes asynchronously. It seems to make sense that it would work that way, but at the same time it would seem to make the usefulness of async/await/task stuff limited to executing operations that have void return type. In other research I have just done, it seems like there are more beneficial use cases of async/await/task within the context of ASP.NET MVC apps and other scenarios in which UIs are involved. But here is the code that I came up with to (kinda) do what I was wanting to do within a simple console app:\r\n\r\nusing System;  \r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;  \r\nusing System.Linq;  \r\nusing System.Text;  \r\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;  \r\nnamespace ConsoleApplication8  \r\n{  \r\n public class Program  \r\n {  \r\n static void Main(string[] args)  \r\n {  \r\n Console.WriteLine(\"In Main, right before calling clsSlowOperationInvoker.InvokeOperationAsync()...\");  \r\n clsSlowOperationInvoker objSlowOperationInvoker = new clsSlowOperationInvoker();  \r\n Task aTask = objSlowOperationInvoker.InvokeOperationAsync();  \r\n Console.WriteLine(\"Code to execute after the clsSlowOperationInvoker.InvokeOperationAsync() invocation...\");  \r\n Console.ReadLine(); // This is just here so the console window doesn't vanish!  \r\n }\r\n\r\n public class clsSlowOperationInvoker  \r\n {  \r\n public async Task InvokeOperationAsync()  \r\n {  \r\n Console.WriteLine(\"In clsSlowOperationInvoker, at beginning of InvokeOperationAsync() method...\");  \r\n clsSlowOperation objSlowOperation = new clsSlowOperation();  \r\n await Task.Run(() => objSlowOperation.Execute());  \r\n }  \r\n }\r\n\r\n public class clsSlowOperation  \r\n {  \r\n public void Execute()  \r\n {  \r\n Console.WriteLine(\"In clsSlowOperation, at beginning of Execute() method...\");  \r\n System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10000); // say this executes a database stored procedure that takes 10 secs  \r\n Console.WriteLine(\"In clsSlowOperation, at end of Execute() method...\");  \r\n }  \r\n }  \r\n }  \r\n}\r\n\r\n// Output of program:  \r\n//  \r\n// In Main, right before calling clsSlowOperationInvoker.InvokeOperationAsync()...  \r\n// In clsSlowOperationInvoker, at beginning of InvokeOperationAsync() method...  \r\n// Code to execute after the clsSlowOperationInvoker.InvokeOperationAsync() invocation...  \r\n// In clsSlowOperation, at beginning of Execute() method...  \r\n// < not part of output - a 10-second delay occurs here >  \r\n// In clsSlowOperation, at end of Execute() method...","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"2f24ce7d-b8ac-34a7-afbc-60c1467b0f61","date":"2015-01-04T08:55:40Z","timestamp":1420361740},{"_id":"6978574f-14fa-3de0-a4e5-590781467708","authorName":"Grateful","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"0c2887c19932ba204e4abe9336971ade","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"Perfect.

In the case of an I/O operation, when the operation completes, it briefly \"borrows\" threads as that completion signal works its way up the stack. When this completion signal reaches the IOCP, it borrows one of the IOCP threads to complete the operation's task (and schedule its continuations). Depending on which operation this is, the BCL may switch to a regular thread pool thread before the task is completed and the continuations are run.\r\n\r\nSo, if an I/O operation uses the IOCP (as most of them do), its completion will come in on either an IOCP thread or a regular thread pool thread. (The .NET thread pool manages both IOCP threads and regular threads). So ConfigureAwait(false) will just continue using the notifying thread in that case. Actually, if the notification comes in on an IOCP thread, ConfigureAwait(false) *might* switch from an IOCP thread to a regular thread pool thread, I don't know off the top of my head.\r\n\r\nWhile it's true that an application may only be concerned with a single UI thread, the thread pool is always there and is utilized by I/O and other parts of the BCL.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"6e0a3be3-54ea-3ccd-880b-b3f1b1ea431f","date":"2015-02-26T19:50:15Z","timestamp":1424980215},{"_id":"698d2205-e64a-3066-bdbb-d6e943bc26dd","authorName":"Adrien","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"08845ad889bcaf135e57b44366d51968","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"Thanks for your prompt response.  \r\nOk.

The second method shows how to call the first method, and illustrates the fact that context capture is per-method. In other words, the button click handler resumes on the UI thread even though the method it calls leaves the context. This is in contrast to the example in Context, in which neither method ever leaves the context.\r\n\r\nRe Async Composition: I prefer to await the tasks, for a couple of reasons. 1) Result will wrap exceptions in an AggregateException, which means catch blocks become much more convoluted; you can avoid this by calling task.GetAwaiter().GetResult() instead of task.Result. 2) if the code is refactored later in a way that the task is no longer (indirectly) awaited earlier in the method, then the await will still properly behave asynchronously, while a Result (or GetAwaiter().GetResult()) call would now block.\r\n\r\nThere's no additional method rewriting necessary for multiple awaits.

It has method that does basically something like this:\r\n\r\n``\r\n\r\nThis method is passed to a ThreadStart, which is used by the UI thread to spawn a Thread, so it's not the UI thread. If I inspect the Thread in Visual Studio, I see that the Thread is not a background thread and not a thread-pool thread.\r\n\r\nOn *very* rare occasions, the thread stalls for well over an hour, after which point I have a DispatcerTimer that would purposefully crash the application if this thread has not made certain progress, which it can't make while it's stalled. My gut feeling is that it's stalling at the async_write.Wait(). But I haven't been able to reproduce the problem in a debug session yet, so I can't be sure. I'm betting my money that this has to do with the fact that I'm writing over the network (SMB 3).\r\n\r\nMy question is: can I be pretty much certain that it's not a deadlock in the async/await/Wait() sense?

The question of whether to make the calls concurrently or sequentially is not one with an easy answer. Or, technically, any answer at all.\r\n\r\nIf you have 3 database calls to the *same database*, then it really depends. You can make 3 concurrent calls if your database backend can scale - e.g., if it's an Azure SQL or NoSQL database. If you're just calling a single db server with a single database on a single disk, then there's (usually) no real benefit to making the calls concurrent.\r\n\r\nAlso note that Entity Framework requires concurrent calls to use separate database connections (contexts). So there's additional overhead to consider there.\r\n\r\nThe only good way to know whether you should make the calls concurrently is to do it both ways and measure the difference.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"c5051e73-3edb-3aaa-996b-d3f260f00157","date":"2015-11-18T02:10:10Z","timestamp":1447812610},{"_id":"e771c7a0-b0bb-3a2e-b39c-c038a37de96b","authorName":"Ram","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"37bd54aba6e837f9e5f46e37a434319a","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"Thank you very much Stephen for your quick response.

A common example is UI objects in a client app: if the \"await\" is, say, retrieving some HTTP resource, and then later that method updates a label or textbox with those results, then that method would need its context because it's accessing UI objects. A less common example is on the server side, where an ASP.NET method has to write to the output stream or do some formatting in the user's current culture (which is part of the ASP.NET context).\r\n\r\nGenerally, you can avoid context capture until your code breaks, and then you know you need it. :)","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"c28cc35d-4dac-35ce-866a-00c51bb9cb82","date":"2016-03-01T13:04:13Z","timestamp":1456837453},{"_id":"c28cc35d-4dac-35ce-866a-00c51bb9cb82","authorName":"vetiarvi","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"7b6460d94795ae02211b102b0dfe5355","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"disqus:vetiarvi","authorFallbackAvatar":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/vetiarvi.jpg","message":"Thank you so much for this.

I have one question for me is not so obvious.\r\n\r\nHere is an example (In Web Api async controller I have asyn action):\r\n\r\n.......  \r\npublic async MyController: ApiController {  \r\n ...async Task GetInfo()  \r\n {  \r\n await from e in DbContext.Entities select e.ToListAsync();  \r\n }  \r\n}  \r\n......\r\n\r\nSo, we have SyncContext which is request context, which in turns is separate thread(T1) from thread pool, which  \r\nactually handles this request. Then we make call to DB (by calling awaiter), which makes free our thread(T1),  \r\nand returns it to ThreadPool (so it become available for other ASP requests). But which thread executes awaiter itself in this case?\r\n\r\nFor me it seems, that we just release one thread and hold another one (for awaiter), but in this case we are loosing time  \r\non marshaling contextes. So WHO executes awaiter in this case? And what advantage of using this in this case you see? Or maybe advice me some tutorial about this.\r\n\r\nThank you!","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"","date":"2016-03-15T14:18:19Z","timestamp":1458051499},{"_id":"bb9d8649-daa5-3268-ba85-f9b8542b3a54","authorName":"Chet Cromer","authorEmailEncrypted":"QTS0lAHN3anNfDoRaai9vyuGJgUdxQm4es/lQtiafzJRQzPqeeGZPgDZb+o1DmOJQ029RyeG5hC3sTU9gbA1KiAGO7vlCGkyOVHcjuGNSY2RkMPl2kabY4k1jCsohxhKTFq3j6dUNZAk0c9Yq5xsb/ANJHTafgdrlc7MfIUBEr2nWuim5IX4nCs1Hj0Vj1ojHEB5rFXtBixlL5x61lr4vVUbwKH1REzlf44X51dbR/e+MZz43ovnpWWUbxCt5WZ+pjFI023GtyHSZprhaUfD5HrBrxGfEriptaf1mckFDqbN4uvadlfBJgKPfHRehCtiJXRhbkB2lQqrJURT1y6+qC0EU+JczppSxfuu+2BnvHMP1zdhmHDUcYgOTb/YTw9gJEL9XiyUPFOYVc03L03s24emIWFZxk53Ds1H+/r3tPDfgASEWL8n2CoUD/pFWAkTs6TtRrqTR5Nucc7vpgj2+MoLFdKjdFr/CEy1qw2hfmsKOmn7vrxKYWToH2GOpEq6kMI7tvmmAH+nxQYUMTAdo2hPEDDxkWMtYn2JVAMfu8wEFM2VQo6eEBEuNZXAnUgsS1XCqX4m+hMwCBTbkMpu36AaeyQWCZ+6rk5IQZwFHQwXPV6fCtPTycLDLtXDCQNyKHx0kDl/F+ip68+kQuQbF+oVeQystFpnutWigILYlfA=","authorEmailMD5":"5d7e5c153437efaf016e8d1b290ced8a","authorUri":"http://www.protegatext.com/free","authorUserId":"disqus:chetcromer","authorFallbackAvatar":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/chetcromer.jpg","message":"Excellent article.

I am just new to this world of asynchronous stuff. So had a few very basic question swirling in my head . Please bear with my lack of knowledge.   \r\n1) You have told \"It tells the awaitable to run the remainder of the method when it completes, and then returns from the async method.\" I did not get this part. So does it mean the method still keeps on running synchronously and waits till the awaitable returns and then proceeds with the rest of the method ?   \r\nIf not please explain then why [task.run](http://task.run) is needed to run a method in the background or in a fire and forget manner. I could still be achieved via await also right ? i.e. The method keeps on executing the rest of the statements without waiting for the await to return . I hope that is similar to a background run approach. Or is not it ? I am confused .\r\n\r\n2)If a method is marked with async and await and that in turn calls another method asynchronously in a separate layer that's also marked with async and await .. then how the the call of the first method that's marked with async and await from a separate method say name ABC should look like ? I do not want to annotate that method to be async/await. So\r\n\r\nTask.Run(() => DoWork()); from ABC () is fine without marking it async/await?

It prints \"Main Thread\" first . Then after 8 seconds complete , \"Long Task\" and then \"New Thread\" get printed.\r\n\r\nThis part I got .

On a different note I have a question regarding how the compiler switches the transfers between async method and caller method. For example when the compiler hits an await keyword with a long running process in async method the control transfers to the caller method (and assuming await code running on thread pool). How is the execution carried forward from caller method, does the control bubble up all the way to the top i.e the Main method while the thread pool takes care of the rest of code in async?","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"40ecf2e9-a5bc-3a70-ad92-c692d15d6bf3","date":"2016-06-01T20:26:53Z","timestamp":1464812813},{"_id":"40ecf2e9-a5bc-3a70-ad92-c692d15d6bf3","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"3db7b6e14d9da42751e4bab03bc4d034","authorUri":"https://stephencleary.com/","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"Both articles are saying the same thing: `await` will continue executing on a captured SynchronizationContext or TaskScheduler, and in the case of a Console application, there is no SynchronizationContext and the TaskScheduler is the thread pool task scheduler, thus they will run on the thread pool in that scenario.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"036fd8b7-a20b-3bec-ade9-5e0267569dde","date":"2016-06-01T18:06:36Z","timestamp":1464804396},{"_id":"64a738ea-f853-3953-9761-899b0f57cdc9","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"3db7b6e14d9da42751e4bab03bc4d034","authorUri":"https://stephencleary.com/","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"I explain the full mechanics of await in this blog post.

So that thread is gone. When the operation completes, there's actually a thread that performs the completion of that task. await has an optimization where it will try to continue on that same thread, if possible. But it's a question of whether or not it can continue on the thread that completes the task, not on the thread the async method was on earlier. That thread is long gone.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"b46f9538-58c7-39b3-a661-079eb12d59d7","date":"2017-04-25T13:49:03Z","timestamp":1493128143},{"_id":"b46f9538-58c7-39b3-a661-079eb12d59d7","authorName":"giulia gualdi","authorEmailEncrypted":"waVcoZnfkrTlLZIx0wdDk6wucf/5PVU2oYz20TuEYKZG4XWOxw9RB9LOLfuEn6paw4IsCDcTm8JUn5XEyXF9weADAJCnkrcmM2sGhPIbLXuw+bLvDfPWZK7Ts6SQVjAUJTsQKRjLPdnB4sK0LGpPdKxoU59n9kiqUccM5PfIspsbKZ+fAExikNIH7Y80mW7sB/WVJ1so28IRaty3Bv9SBC07xYoT9hBQXWXXF45QDE18de7kDuv/xMmFCkUmo4Psg3KfzkCxpudg7MVO/+KGLyxea7ByVVyiczts1ud3Cdx0gUEbyAKBZfU5vubfidh/5oyvJVkZ6UKTDGNWVvZCfexVrtdThd4+8hWRdm4NcO5jhcocnNMzSLhGcTkiIDwWpN0hOzA2O5bhVWEyJtA2Ug1YVshb4V/21GUWgv6a/Y8ozeXDVXCYhE+ryKlwv86g+/nYkd/7c67uIEEEf/152KFFc/Vd1Boio3Yi0DJ3jU0lPOwRAZMkP6qKye1nMeMP6jKzW03mZckhNN7BeLznkL7nNae3CWWFHasKmW1KYKqrmkPozX6iswmg4H9Ns1lib40nvFdadQu7Mp6RbxvX3E8jnYFbGKIlC00SZ0iQt3Lds9/rk/PrS+PDvYffT+tlZgPaUQPuScfi8IcMpJHhxLtKJqBXqSoz9HLMfQh8JPg=","authorEmailMD5":"9735d2c2dfabf8d681d31dcb03135678","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"disqus:giuliagualdi","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"Hi Stephen thanks a lot for your reply, and for pointing me to a relevant blog entry. Just one more question to make sure I fully understand what you mean: I understood that whereas Task.Run()offloads the computation to a thread pool thread, ConfigureAwait(false) only says that the current context can be ignored and, as a consequence, the method can run on any available thread. In this respect the thread switch is not necessarily implied but could happen for \"internal optimisation\" purposes. Now, if there is no context to capture then such optimisation is not triggered and no thread switch would occur. Is this correct? thanks again","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"7f1af948-648d-3f77-a2fd-a157340b5b3f","date":"2017-04-25T08:50:36Z","timestamp":1493110236},{"_id":"67f34e8c-0bad-39da-87c3-366cfff8193f","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"3db7b6e14d9da42751e4bab03bc4d034","authorUri":"https://stephencleary.com/","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"The \"thread that performs the completion of the task\" is a temporarily borrowed thread. E.g., I/O operations do not need to block a thread during their operation, but they do need to \"borrow\" threads for very brief work like copying data and completing tasks.

It wraps all endpoints in  \r\nreturn Task.Factory.StartNew(() => {...});\r\n\r\nInternally all endpoints behave similarly:  \r\n1. Through the Web Api, an action is \"queued\" to the database and the request \"waits\", by periodically querying the database for the queued action. When it's completed the request returns the result.  \r\n2. IoT devices connect to the same server asking for pending commands, executing and \"completing\" them.\r\n\r\nThis whole waiting does not seem correct, but to change it will take time in this project. So in the meantime I would like to tackle the Start New Task part. Is there something I could change?  \r\nThanks in advance!

If one of those methods throws an exception before Task.WhenAll, then that exception would be captured and placed on the Task (not raised directly). The WhenAll then observes that task and re-throws any exceptions.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible that the Task-returning method has a bug and may throw an exception directly.

When the async method hits an await, it returns an incompleted Task. The thread can do whatever it wants.\r\n\r\nFor example, a thread *may* choose to block on the Task (e.g., by calling GetAwaiter().GetResult(), Wait(), or Result on the Task). In that case, yes, the thread is blocked until the async method completes. Please note that this is **not** recommended usage! One of the key async principles is \"don't block on async code\" - not only does it prevent the code from actually being asynchronous (obviously), it also can easily cause deadlocks. Instead, you should use \"async all the way\". More info here: [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj991977.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj991977.aspx)\r\n\r\nSo, how about a more realistic example of how threads behave in an \"async all the way\" scenario?  \r\nWith \"async all the way\", each Task is consumed by an await, which means that method returns an incompleted Task, which is awaited, so it's caller returns an incompleted Task, etc., all they way back to some kind of entry point.\r\n\r\nMost threading scenarios fall into one of two styles, depending on how the entry point works:\r\n\r\n1) Message loop. UI threads that use \"async all the way\" will eventually end up at an async void event handler (or what is logically an event handler, such as ICommand.Execute). In this case, when the await is hit in that method, it will return back to the message loop. The UI thread then continues processing its message loop normally. It is not blocked on any Tasks. It does block on whatever GetNextWin32Message API that it executes in its message loop.  \r\nEventually (when the operation completes), the continuation of the async method is queued to the message loop, where it is picked up and processed by the UI thread like any other message.\r\n\r\n2) Thread pool. The most common example here is ASP.NET. ASP.NET threads that use \"async all the way\" will eventually end up at an async Task controller method. In this case, when the await is hit in that method, it returns an incompleted Task to the ASP.NET runtime. The runtime then sets up a callback on that Task and frees that thread back to the thread pool. In this case, there's no blocking at all; the thread is completely free to be reused by other requests.  \r\nEventually (when the operation completes), the ASP.NET runtime grabs any available thread pool thread and executes the continuation of the async method.\r\n\r\nThread pool threads without ASP.NET (e.g., via Task.Run) behave similarly: when their await is hit, the thread is returned to the thread pool, and when the Task completes, any available thread pool thread executes the continuation of the async method.\r\n\r\nThere are some more rare scenarios as well. Sometimes it's useful to have a single thread that maintains a queue of work (similar to the message loop), but without any UI dependencies. This is more rare but certainly doable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf it helps, you can think of async/await/Task as just a nicer syntax for setting up a chain of callbacks. Each await registers a callback with the Task it's awaiting and then returns. So when you have a chain of async methods all calling and await'ing each other (which is the common case), then you end up with a chain of callbacks, starting at the innermost Task and pointing to its caller's method. This is how they actually exist in memory - as a chain of callback delegates.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"2bd586f0-f2e8-3c7b-a28d-37b58589fe8f","date":"2018-05-01T14:47:32Z","timestamp":1525186052},{"_id":"37302d2f-ea93-380b-b0ff-39fcf76f93bd","authorName":"User135711","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"5550d22bce46229d78b139d795d66392","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"disqus:user13571","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"Are the methods in your example above (\"DoOperation0Async();\" etc...) started in parallel by being async task and you didn't await them?","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"","date":"2018-05-06T08:31:56Z","timestamp":1525595516},{"_id":"20d625e0-cadd-3af4-83be-caeeded0e21f","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"3db7b6e14d9da42751e4bab03bc4d034","authorUri":"https://stephencleary.com/","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"That's what makes them concurrent, yes.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"37302d2f-ea93-380b-b0ff-39fcf76f93bd","date":"2018-05-08T20:43:42Z","timestamp":1525812222},{"_id":"2e3bddb0-95d8-11e8-9ace-75653aad6cc4","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","postUri":"http://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html","replyTo":"0387bef0-4d4d-3d2d-b976-a14644b2cbdc","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"","authorName":"Michael Harper","authorUri":"","message":"This reply cleared a lot up for me thanks!

Here's the most common examples:\r\n- UI components must be accessed by their owning thread. The UI context will ensure that the code after `await` will resume running on the UI thread.\r\n- `HttpContext.Current` should only be accessed from within a request context. The ASP.NET Classic context will ensure that the code after `await` will be in the same request context. (ASP.NET Core does not have `HttpContext.Current` and does not need a context).\r\n\r\nMore generally, though, it's possible for you to create your own hosting system that has some definition of a \"context\", and you can write a `SynchronizationContext` that will integrate with `async`/`await` to resume on that context after every `await`. I've done this with my `AsyncContext` class, which is a thread with a context that always resumes on that thread, so it's like the UI context but without any UI capabilities (it's not an STA thread, does no message pumping, etc).","date":"2019-01-08T14:54:02.387Z"},{"_id":"4a2f7c70-232c-11e9-b607-f720b75a151c","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","postUri":"https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html","replyTo":"","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"","authorName":"Sanjeev","authorUri":"","message":"Hi Stephen,\r\n\r\nI had the confusion around the UIContext and the UIThread.

More specifically, there is one timer thread that queues up the timer events (to the thread pool) as each timer fires. But this is just an implementation detail. There are lots of low-level optimizations around how `async` uses the thread pool. It's entirely possible that the timer thread may change to understand `SynchronizationContext` and queue the timer events directly to that context rather than a thread pool thread.

You can think of it this way: the request is sent immediately (starting the asynchronous operation), but it wouldn't make sense for a thread to just sit there waiting for the server to respond. There's just no point in using a thread that's just blocked on reading I/O anyway. It makes sense to just have a `Task` that represents an *event* (\"the response from the server has arrived\"), and only resume executing when that event occurs (i.e., the task is completed).\r\n\r\nThe long answer is a bit more complex, but that's the general gist. :)","date":"2020-06-26T15:41:00.639Z"},{"_id":"13dda4c0-b9ea-11ea-a35b-4f830f5cfcff","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","postUri":"https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html","replyTo":"","authorEmailEncrypted":"qjjivWIsaq5qLhsCCIRKdt0wNqCyW9+Cy5lwR8w5HYeBKTNqc5aM2h7MWUBlJRM5EeGtyq4R0ufEbnlQQrpdMaypFxKRh81AN0POcYFvCpYzccgsGhmkQYcWYyz/24rchHLwpTQuGVM0nqDowHWisrqhXRUj1d+FQeL1gEBA0X8YyJ4vWApi7/UKMA0NvIUM7PIt9eDv4Kib465Iyw6sxshvbLCXI6ey9MBRniXYUxL7ehULAsF1MgQtZmKfhEmuLd1GgRqqrm4iOjrO1OJL+t/y2t8QHsFUpsgu4xXL/8+7BhluiVDI4g2ug2twHkbAnkQWgHEj9+PrTKbPgbzWrZBLkADpfIddHZT2TwcHvxSbuhDYlNz6coTGQc5ahf24alKZKnClZMbqiVqs3ERNRvfIzB8/3ZuqXrwB49Thabxo5YxeKjrwwZp9UOhSKMvQYRJhztGwYTgTBlL7Sh/wNEvLxx4nWup7yh1UkY4z+0fSWJ614WyArkEfW7R+wLbp6wOx9Yti6STDAtUw/IRJpZnXhHFUoPNqN+cHxgC4x/TOPXXJyHbr/uUcGTSVXH6DQJzp1rOnph9ciTOcaZZxRixTbwawC3ajao2e6BZXEoYaHRo1ASvDknW3b0y7jnSo+U8lYFtXP6dMk7BErHLVbi89OIY9CGuJ+f5o/zfdFt0=","authorEmailMD5":"793ccbb535bfd6b522f589e553e80110","authorName":"Ensign Nemo","authorUri":"","message":"Hi - the link to the \"async/await FAQ\" has gone 404, but I think it can now be found here: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/asyncawait-faq/","date":"2020-06-29T09:22:39.744Z"},{"_id":"4a2e32e0-bc62-11ea-bd69-452e7adaa71f","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","postUri":"https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html","replyTo":"7da1e900-bc2b-11ea-91f0-81e2666d7aaf","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"23448e78d187fba56d8bc263081ac5d8","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorUri":"https://stephencleary.com","message":"It may help to think of `await ReadFileAsyncMethodAsync();` as being the same as `Task task = ReadFileAsyncMethodAsync(); await task;`.\r\n\r\nIn other words, `ReadFileAsyncMethodAsync` is always called just like any other method; the only difference is whether the `Task` is `await`ed or not.

It's never been documented *exactly* what the request context is, but it's at least:\r\n\r\n- `HttpContext.Current`\r\n- The page culture\r\n- The page identity (i.e., user identity)\r\n\r\nSo, consider this part of the code:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar jsonTask = await GetJsonAsync(new Uri(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's run like this:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar task = GetJsonAsync(new Uri(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos\"));\r\nvar jsonTask = await task;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the initial request is made, this is what happens in `Get`:\r\n\r\n1. ASP.NET takes a thread from the thread pool and creates a request context. The thread enters the request context (i.e., setting `HttpContext.Current` and the current page culture and identity).\r\n1. That thread starts running your action, calls `GetJsonAsync`, and gets back an incomplete task.\r\n1. At the `await`, the task is not completed, so the current context is captured and the action method returns an incomplete task. This causes ASP.NET to return the thread to the thread pool.\r\n\r\nWe'll come back to what happens after the `await` in a minute.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar jsonString = await client.GetStringAsync(uri).ConfigureAwait(false);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's run like this:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar task = client.GetStringAsync(uri);\r\nvar configuredTask = task.ConfigureAwait(false);\r\nvar jsonString = await configuredTask;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what happens in `GetJsonAsync`:\r\n\r\n1. The current thread (which is still in the ASP.NET request context) calls `GetStringAsync` and gets back an incomplete task.\r\n1. This task is configured. What `ConfigureAwait` actually does is return a configured task wrapper around that task. In this case, the wrapper is saying it doesn't want to continue on the captured ASP.NET request context.\r\n1. At the `await`, the task is not completed, so this method returns an incomplete task to `Get` (which then does its own `await`, returning from the action, and causing ASP.NET to return the thread to the thread pool, as we saw above).\r\n\r\nSome time later, `GetStringAsync` will complete. It actually completes on a thread pool thread, because there's some copying into the string and whatnot that had to happen once the data arrived. So `HttpClient`'s code does a little bit of work on a thread pool thread to create the string instance to pass to your code. Then that same code completes the task.\r\n\r\nWhen the `GetStringAsync` task completes, this is what happens in your code:\r\n\r\n1. The code continues running `GetJsonAsync`. Note that the current thread is a thread pool thread that has not entered any ASP.NET context.\r\n1. The `await` checks for exceptions on the task; there aren't any so it doesn't throw, and instead it assigns the string instance to `jsonString`.\r\n1. The method continues executing. Since it is a thread pool thread without an ASP.NET context, `HttpContext.Current` will be `null`.\r\n1. Eventually, `GetJsonAsync` completes. When this happens, the current thread completes the task that was earlier returned from `GetJsonAsync`. At this point, the code is still running on that thread pool thread without an ASP.NET context.\r\n\r\nWhen the `GetJsonAsync` task completes, this is what happens in the original `Get` method:\r\n\r\n1. Since the `await` in `Get` was used without `ConfigureAwait(false)`, it will resume on the captured context. This is the original ASP.NET request context.\r\n1. At this point, the current thread enters the ASP.NET request context, getting `HttpContext.Current` set as well as the culture and identity.\r\n1. The code in `Get` continues running. The `return` statement completes the task that `Get` returned earlier to the ASP.NET runtime, which lets ASP.NET know that the request is complete.\r\n\r\nSo, the main takeaways are:\r\n\r\n1. `ConfigureAwait(false)` can only affect its own method.\r\n1. There is only one thread pool. There's not \"ASP.NET threads\" that are separate from \"raw threads\" or anything like that.\r\n1. Thread pool threads may enter a request context when necessary.\r\n\r\nSide note: ASP.NET Core no longer has a context, so on that platform this is a lot simpler. `ConfigureAwait(false)` has no effect on ASP.NET Core.","date":"2021-08-28T13:09:35.909Z"},{"_id":"fc113620-08d7-11ec-ad63-fb4340f1771f","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","postUri":"https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html","replyTo":"3152c420-0801-11ec-945d-510d5893e7ec","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"","authorName":"west","authorUri":"","message":"So at the beginning thread pool thread which handles asp.net context is same thread after ConfigureAwait(false).

In the case of already-completed tasks, the `await` doesn't \"yield\" and therefore doesn't \"resume\". In that case, the `async` method continues executing (synchronously, on the same thread). That's why `await Task.CompletedTask.ConfigureAwait(false)` does nothing: the task is already complete, so there's no resuming, so the method doesn't resume executing on a thread pool thread; it just continues executing on whatever thread it's already on.\n\nThis is less of a problem with true asynchronous code (i.e., file downloads), but it *can* still happen (mobile devices in particular cache web requests heavily, and can complete file downloads immediately and synchronously).

There are various scenarios where async doesn't work well, and that forces a redesign. Which is good.\n\nIn this specific instance, async doesn't work with constructors. Well... it *shouldn't* work with constructors. Asynchronous code, generally speaking, is usually doing I/O operations. And no constructors should be doing I/O operations. I have a [blog post](https://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/01/async-oop-2-constructors.html) specifically addressing async with constructors. Most of the time, I recommend using an asynchronous factory pattern instead. I.e., if an object requires some I/O to exist, then there should be some other object responsible for doing that I/O and constructing that object.\n\nHowever, \"async constructors\" is often asked in another rather common scenario: when the constructor is for a ViewModel (or VM-like type), what's usually going on is that the user wants to do some I/O to load data to show to the user. Again, asynchronous code in a constructor here is just the wrong thing in the first place, but in the case of ViewModels, asynchronous factories don't work either (the UI must be shown immediately). So the appropriate solution for VMs is something more like [asynchronous data binding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2014/march/async-programming-patterns-for-asynchronous-mvvm-applications-data-binding?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5000058), where the VM initializes into a \"Loading\" state and then updates into a \"Display\" state.\n\nHope this helps!\n       -Steve","date":"2023-02-10T15:54:29.1487685Z"},{"_id":"87c579ee-7a97-465f-b372-ad0e63155cb6","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","postUri":"https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html","replyTo":"","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"963fc986ba391ec7a3b1330baa46b249","authorName":"ShG","authorUri":"","message":"Hi, Stephen.

See [It's All about the SynchronizationContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2011/february/msdn-magazine-parallel-computing-it-s-all-about-the-synchronizationcontext) for more about what it actually is. The ASP.NET `SynchronizationContext` does not have a specific thread associated with it; it is applied to any available thread pool thread.\n\nWinForms/WPF also have a `SynchronizationContext`, but theirs *is* tied to a specific thread (the UI thread). This misleads some developers to think that *all* `SynchronizationContext`s are tied to specific threads, or that `ConfigureAwait(true)` resumes on the current thread - neither of which are always true. In the specific case of a UI `SynchronizationContext`, it is tied to a specific thread, and `ConfigureAwait(true)` will resume on that thread. But that's not true in general - and specifically not true for ASP.NET.","date":"2023-11-01T14:26:45.7582758Z"},{"_id":"38f39ab9-dcdd-4d5f-8865-0917f93c4d47","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","postUri":"https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html","replyTo":"c28cacfd-213e-48d1-b042-a6c067879544","authorEmailEncrypted":"G4TlJq1kGnewIyxO/2c90ocTIUaZdpLvm5H/C17xOFExsyz2XBwYw0iIe6+9Jo43gK0jvrR2shyJVba4EsNhqWHadPI4HsIKvf/K6PvboUox6Zy74t5pxpEgqaZ2dpY5dBqKYvKQoeSKUO4r82u7ePQCs2XQiDjBwOGdaAvvWQGLqOznuYNnhT+bL/xYRcZ6lyc/YoOPrJSSfC96OGwcCuLCrxHhNTIn1IEQgB9p1X4yS8xg2LsRrEbu9Xd7usBJUYvw+CB1zQoxRfo3n6Ur2wTyploO02c9gJybGRQdDv6VgXsL9WBPcTM6IkWEfwU0krntMLCRWDHNF7mgT+GH4aRdi32s1bK8dUHmCPSTAUhQ72er32akmMiRMX8DHjGudmNMD+RnNnzHQ+f6Uk3OKl1cx0c/lcZ18K8J1Gn01kDbUWwcTN7H2mAJ0+NZTRtGfK73vd+995g12bwjJJsqr5/RiPHshoQ3RdsPzmct5Xu2dSao3JtG0jGJQ6fI8J6bmHBAtwFYAOKOz8ngPMJVOK5IvFaSFMrFsdd3aIp8zBsodteutnSHirNJVRkNRYP8hVkrvNAPG72jwdUKuztF6t5guvCvBCEcQ/TZ4+fdT83VFOPPj09jmWe3PR0UoE+uW1I6jkHN/gUVOlyheZjiVgyteAYD21d7JqiLEl5m0MU=","authorEmailMD5":"963fc986ba391ec7a3b1330baa46b249","authorName":"ShG","authorUri":"","message":"Thank you, Stephen!","date":"2023-11-02T07:17:03.2661698Z"},{"_id":"d6fc802e-5c5e-4be6-8c40-7eb3ee730621","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","postUri":"https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html","replyTo":"","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"","authorName":"Ghostyshka","authorUri":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/zahorodniidenys/","message":"cool topic, written 12 years ago but simple to understand ","date":"2024-03-25T11:03:04.1262380Z"},{"_id":"08dd5086-1a7c-45f5-82e5-c1b32f7a9d9a","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","postUri":"https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html","replyTo":"","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"eb29b10d31ac61a891c237462b2514e5","authorName":"Smith","authorUri":"","message":"Old topic and I hope it is still valid.

It uses _fewer_ threads to accomplish the same thing.\n\nOn the client side, the focus is usually on freeing up the UI thread. E.g., doing a DB query so that the UI doesn't freeze. For background code in UI apps synchronous code is fine; it does end up using more threads than necessary, but that usually isn't a big deal. In the UI layer, though, async is a more natural way to write code even if the \"asynchronous\" background operation itself is synchronous code running on another thread.\n\nIn contrast, server-side code is more sensitive to thread usage, due to aspects like the limited thread pool injection rate. Server apps get scalability benefits when using async instead of sync code, often on the order of 30x. And async servers can also scale more quickly during a spike in demand.","date":"2024-08-31T16:52:39.1454474Z"},{"_id":"2485dad1-862b-471b-8e99-626c74eb854d","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","postUri":"https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html","replyTo":"222b99a3-1dff-4a09-ad66-0fbfc4beb74d","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"eb29b10d31ac61a891c237462b2514e5","authorName":"Smith","authorUri":"","message":"Thanks for the fast reply.
