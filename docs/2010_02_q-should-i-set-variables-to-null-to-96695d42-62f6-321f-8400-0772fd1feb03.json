If when one sets a variable to null trying to aid the GC, I can't remember whether the JIT thus then *extends* the 'rooted' block up to there, thus actually making things much worse. Or does the JIT recognises it being a special case of setting null and ignores it. Hmm. Anyway, just don't null blindly.  \r\n\r\nThe only case I've ever had to set a local to null is within a while loop on a thread:  \r\n\r\nvoid _Runner(object state)  \r\n{  \r\n while(true) {  \r\n Command cmd = GetNextFromQueue();  \r\n ...action it...  \r\n // Must null 'cmd' here otherwise it stays   \r\n // alive, which has a reference to our parent,   \r\n // and (if when forget to Dispose it) it stays   \r\n // alive, and so its finalizer is never called  \r\n // which means we stay alive, keeping the 'cmd'  \r\n // alive, which means...  \r\n cmd = null;  \r\n }  \r\n}  \r\n\r\nWell it was something like that anyway...","postId":"2010_02_q-should-i-set-variables-to-null-to-96695d42-62f6-321f-8400-0772fd1feb03","replyTo":"","date":"2010-03-05T01:40:32Z","timestamp":1267753232,"authorUserId":""}]
