Unfortunately, only one has ever accepted it. I think it is the best-attended talk I've ever had (after scaling for conference size(. Standing room only, people out in the hallway straining to hear. So I find it really curious that no other tech conference has ever accepted that talk. Well, I'm bad at writing abstracts, so that's probably why.
