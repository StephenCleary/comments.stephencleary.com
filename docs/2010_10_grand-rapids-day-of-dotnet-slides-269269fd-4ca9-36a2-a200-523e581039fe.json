Very informative.  \r\n\r\nAbout a week ago, a customer of mine directed me to your site to reference your post on \"Detection of Half-Open (Dropped) Connections\" as we were defining our interface protocol. I paid attention to the content but not the author (sorry). I was shocked when I realized that material I was just referencing for a real world project was being presented to me in person. \"Pleasantly\" shocked :)  \r\n\r\nThanks again.  \r\n\r\nRon","postId":"2010_10_grand-rapids-day-of-dotnet-slides-269269fd-4ca9-36a2-a200-523e581039fe","replyTo":"","date":"2010-10-28T01:24:13Z","timestamp":1288229053,"authorUserId":""}]
