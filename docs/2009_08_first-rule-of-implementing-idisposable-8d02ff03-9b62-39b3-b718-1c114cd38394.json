There are three different approaches that I've seen:  \r\n1) The class providing the event treats its event subscriptions as managed resources, unsubscribing all of its subscribers when it is disposed. [This is William's recommendation above].  \r\n2) The class receiving the event treats its event subscriptions as managed resources, unsubscribing from its providers when it is disposed. This pattern is commonly found in MVVM projects, and is a little trickier to implement.  \r\n3) The event subscription itself is considered a managed resource, initially owned by whatever component created the event subscription. This more closely follows the pattern used by the Rx framework.","postId":"2009_08_first-rule-of-implementing-idisposable-8d02ff03-9b62-39b3-b718-1c114cd38394","replyTo":"","date":"2010-03-02T21:03:45Z","timestamp":1267563825,"authorUserId":""},{"_id":"4105a5e4-1b67-351e-912b-00034e41b01c","authorName":"Anonymous","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"","message":"What if in your example the list holds thousands of custom types.
