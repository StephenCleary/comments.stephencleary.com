With cache being relatively expensive and billed based on size, it makes sense to pick the most compact serializer out of the gate. I'm sure that most cache operations are much faster than their database or service counterparts -- that is their whole purpose, after all -- but I can't help wondering if there's a significant size/speed trade-off between them all. You hinted at it a bit with BSON vs JSON; any insights or too soon to tell?","postId":"2013_12_azure-cache-serialization-with-json-7b83166e-9e0c-341d-9c7b-974e40dd7030","replyTo":"","date":"2013-12-13T00:23:04Z","timestamp":1386894184},{"_id":"c209a498-e6d8-3a6e-9591-7d3ab5bee770","authorName":"Anonymous","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"Thanks for the article Stephen.
