If the block doesn't want the data right then, Post will (immediately) return false. So I consider it \"synchronous\" from the point of view of the caller. It's \"asynchronous\" from the point of view of the mesh, because Post will just queue the item in the block's input buffer if possible.  \r\n\r\nSendAsync is asynchronous from both points of view: if necessary, it will (asynchronously) wait until the block is ready.  \r\n\r\nIn most situations, blocks don't restrict their input, so there's no difference between Post and SendAsync most of the time. A notable exception is when you set BoundedCapacity on the block options. A bounded block will attempt to postpone any incoming data if it's already full; this is where Post and SendAsync differ (Post returns false; SendAsync asynchronously waits for the block to have space available).","postId":"2012_09_introduction-to-dataflow-part-1-980c1479-b370-3974-8cf2-c1b8c36b44c9","replyTo":"","date":"2013-03-23T01:04:57Z","timestamp":1364000697,"authorUserId":""},{"_id":"c5fdd2ff-e7ca-31a2-935d-89ceebd91f1c","authorName":"Mark Zvilius","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"","message":"Thanks.","postId":"2012_09_introduction-to-dataflow-part-1-980c1479-b370-3974-8cf2-c1b8c36b44c9","replyTo":"","date":"2013-03-24T02:31:20Z","timestamp":1364092280,"authorUserId":""},{"_id":"b6414c54-ad6f-39e7-8c63-ee84e298ee1c","authorName":"Abdul Jeelani","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"b3eef3823290b09dd3e2aded4192339e","message":"Hi Stephen, I ve read your post as well as your cookbook.

TPL Dataflow permits the same kind of parallelism, and also supports asynchronous concurrency. If your Do1/Do2 are synchronous, then doing it with Parallel or doing it with TPL Dataflow is pretty much the same thing.\r\n\r\nRegarding ObserveOn, this is a way for Rx data to \"jump\" thread contexts, usually used in the middle of a query so that the first part of it is executed on a thread pool thread (e.g., throttling), and then after the ObserveOn the rest of the query is executed on a UI thread (e.g., updating UI elements). TPL Dataflow also permits \"jumping\" contexts in that each block has its own scheduler. In the TPL Dataflow world, while the scheduler *can* be used on an ActionBlock for UI updates, it is more commonly used with a ConcurrentExclusiveSchedulerPair to coordinate one or more TransformBlocks/ActionBlocks with each other.","postId":"2012_09_introduction-to-dataflow-part-1-980c1479-b370-3974-8cf2-c1b8c36b44c9","replyTo":"b6414c54-ad6f-39e7-8c63-ee84e298ee1c","date":"2017-12-05T20:10:48Z","timestamp":1512504648,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"},{"_id":"d53cbe33-da4f-3a64-b2cb-096926d24a7f","authorName":"Abdul Jeelani","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"b3eef3823290b09dd3e2aded4192339e","message":"Thanks, but how exactly you differentiate synchronous concurrency v asynchronous concurrency,   \r\nIn my case Do1 and Do2 are independent, that work on a received item from a stream.
