Itâ€™s very unnatural to call Task.Wait in an async method\" \r\n\r\nExactly like this of course not, but at some point you will have to wait this way or another. For example in console program you won't have any explicit `Wait` but the program will wait implicitly, causing a deadlock as well. So this is not some rare case,, all it takes that Try/Set methods are used in non-async block. Add `await Task.Delay()...` before the call to `Try/Set` call and everyting is fine.","date":"2019-01-28T08:43:20.282Z"},{"_id":"c3a23690-2329-11e9-b607-f720b75a151c","postId":"2012_12_dont-block-in-asynchronous-code-a0a59620-1e0c-32fa-84cc-c17451ad4837","postUri":"https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/12/dont-block-in-asynchronous-code.html","replyTo":"c3677b50-22d8-11e9-897b-9f0ee46a84c2","authorEmailEncrypted":"fP5GGmDUdZBcGcNlHlucYX18RRBixrBARW7uJe717nHwrrKYz4i1ogoyb9GDuVashpNODD8B6BYgNONlPDs77zBmd8Ab2mxFX53BRq2GHOMTKzBahBRF2WmZNVm5jsPvKdjSwr+04LrjK7xS4KbLw4n8+ad4bW8VLT3QJNe7bfq8SSvv6WinlgotafQM2q+6O4ZAlCxFeaoJDVWyEuYGv5yJG1skRRPZo9jmzZG8pqjpBQGsSZHerpqgSj6a1gSpTaed6D3xtBw6xn/1/bmuutedZNIEQsLKXiBJ0j2guUNDxgI5AqNg+GRsDn/tnUzTmaDmFCUR3oPYb/ow97RJ8unQ3MF7ax4NtWyNtxD+uq5Tpgs9uvsgBl25vl2PEzM+/5vX3iZvkGBeGyEgLUki3KKMTgNqFor4Kn+dCedwXUyMT/DezDZfaNeG8CZnSI1CoROZVtMAq9Yg3fNgs71EY5qaWu+y4ONDg4301bVvQqVARW0GDqA8Z4jbyYpmjya/9v9/4ufJkxXWJAy6O53zkysYNPCVqHFk++riC8D/atWbhCrnUqrwGmWTs8HwDOaBKJCeGfR2pZwEbNe5cCJxa3Cx1Bd4mEeoSvP1yBdZ4J0PrVoA3rydlCpLygHnozP2U2m8zNtxaPEEBoF5NG1Hv7WP35fhkrCHiutn4i/m0sY=","authorEmailMD5":"23448e78d187fba56d8bc263081ac5d8","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorUri":"https://stephencleary.com","message":"I stand by my statement that blocking on asynchronous code is unnatural.\r\n\r\nIn server-side applications like ASP.NET Core, the entire stack is asynchronous. There is never any blocking, even within the ASP.NET runtime or IIS.\r\n\r\nClient-side GUI applications are also a natural fit for asynchrony; the UI thread runs a main loop, and async/await interacts with that loop natively. Again, there is no blocking necessary.\r\n\r\nConsole applications are the *one* place where blocking is normal, and it's only normal to block in one line of code in the entire application, in order to prevent the main thread from exiting. What's more, modern platforms allow `async Main`, which hides that blocking in the runtime.","date":"2019-01-28T18:23:09.852Z"}]
