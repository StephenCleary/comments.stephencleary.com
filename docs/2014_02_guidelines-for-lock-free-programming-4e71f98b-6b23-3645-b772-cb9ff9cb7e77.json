There doesn't seem to be a single-reader-single-writer lock-free queue. I had to write one myself. Went from gigabytes of allocations per second to nothing. I will admit that the worse case of a single-writer-single-reader lock free is the queue falsely thinks there is nothing to work on or it is full, but it is an example of lock-free that doesn't fall under \"don't\". Unless you're using non-x86, then don't use my implementation :-)\r\n\r\nGC pressure can negatively affect thread scaling since it causes a stop-world.\r\n\r\nMy single greatest example was some high performance C# program where a code-path that occurred about 10% of the time had a \".foreach\" coupled with a very simple lambda. This single line, which 95% of the time operated on a list count of 1, accounted for over 98% of my memory allocations. My program couldn't consume more than about 50% CPU on a 32 core server, constantly stalling on GC. I changed that one line into a FOR statement, and my CPU usage jumped up to 99.5%+ and a text label that updated once per second to indicate estimated time remaining now accounted for 60% of my memory allocations.\r\n\r\nDo not underestimate the cost of allocating objects.","postId":"2014_02_guidelines-for-lock-free-programming-4e71f98b-6b23-3645-b772-cb9ff9cb7e77","replyTo":"","date":"2015-03-16T17:51:18Z","timestamp":1426528278},{"_id":"4d1f78c2-2708-3777-8a80-7aa7e21e5408","authorName":"Chan Fun Chiat","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"5dea3e9fa56bf704d900e2677b76792e","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"disqus:fcchan","authorFallbackAvatar":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/fcchan.jpg","message":"This article is not for newbie to locking topic","postId":"2014_02_guidelines-for-lock-free-programming-4e71f98b-6b23-3645-b772-cb9ff9cb7e77","replyTo":"","date":"2015-11-17T02:38:40Z","timestamp":1447727920},{"_id":"b33247db-25a5-39f3-a211-4f608ecfe152","authorName":"Andre Soares","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"804aee742efaa7a85465e07f45fbac25","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"disqus:andregsilv","authorFallbackAvatar":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/andregsilv.jpg","message":"Hahahaha!
