This has been operational for many years. Then one day, the listening socket for HTTPS seemingly simply closed (HTTP was still open.) Our apps listener socket continually services new connections from other clients.\r\n\r\nCan a large amount of submissions from clients to the port cause this to close/crash? I only ask since there was a large number of submissions around this time. Is it possible for port exhaustion to cause the listener to close? The submissions came from same client. Confused, any small pointers greatly appreciated. Running on 2003 server. I could create a watcher thread to periodically attempt connections on 443 / 80 and if unable to connect then reattempt creation of the listening sockets.","postId":"2009_05_using-socket-as-server-listening-socket-e3fb46d4-2872-3d9f-bd52-4ba451a0689a","replyTo":"","date":"2017-10-06T10:30:23Z","timestamp":1507285823,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_a7UBianRUN"},{"_id":"d352975a-5cb1-3063-8806-db5ca8ad7c6e","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"ad2250182ff26a84dda974e50cd94382","message":"The first thing I would check is how errors are handled from Accept. They should be ignored (after logging, if you want). In particular, you don't want any kind of error preventing Accept from being called again.\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge, large number of connections cannot cause a listening socket to close on its own. If more connections come in than there is a backlog for, they would just be rejected automatically by the OS.","postId":"2009_05_using-socket-as-server-listening-socket-e3fb46d4-2872-3d9f-bd52-4ba451a0689a","replyTo":"11b5f03b-ad7b-3a59-820a-5dbfee4971e7","date":"2017-10-06T22:49:15Z","timestamp":1507330155,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"},{"_id":"8d5987d4-0356-3a0e-b32c-21f60983321d","authorName":"GJ","authorEmailEncrypted":"mWuKCOsAOVE/RINXwyfDi5um6Ndj43jN8AmGueAoAR8rtDCHSwwp06ZpSy3AQfDgRUDuYlAXIKmIUVuRxfHXgfXgYEwvXl5abcsLSgpcgjYQ0jCopEh5BJv0hK7Zq9E/eCWTwTE0Nq4mw7puLy+Cski8UoThkt9DtZhHlirbmMsBn4gmIdhZh6tY9PzjBgHy/k+zUQYA1cYWtvtSnLq1zhcb/pAqLriHhFJ9tUqRriC4hOSHtQjhdIhHYxvKBL2/kDsSoRp8FgEbKJnf6sf0ZAvZeRqd8PTG23kg9FcAL85pB+UOGGSlE6P0FD9QB7vWzTFW0MSm57uHjJQnRIUHEJQHONiRJ76wQ3zWmcHuj9WPiTLWjGMb3aOUulu9+u9UhjmrWdBV8vjRviZMxZmhylPqXXh93DaCn5A/jsUQMVHby3b8aBwaLE5QRIZApWMPfCXGSC/ZRfI8plwojgs3RwZvPBBePk06MI6I5jZC1jpO/fse2uRCWIOSxEAwHSbAxTA58pdAm3LaZtq0EjHuqqBqsISCW69kvGEwAzBIQji9ppZLtfhx3KGjUeq2G1sKq/0e6muDFi+Ibzc38h1a4SdjpkmGKx6DwaBSmzWlY4drhywz4x/bbP8wYEI7voz3gTszuSR/i/1Cum0BX9HYa7kswukpWIZ5yyaw9Q03KlI=","authorEmailMD5":"53e4cefc220eac057f36702aabdf6e6a","message":"Thanks for replying Stephen. Much appreciated. Adding logging on the Accept to see what the heck is happening. It's a once in a blue moon scenario so I'll just probs add this into the build and see when it crops up.\r\n\r\nAs you, I thought the backlogged connections would simply be rejected. Thanks for afirming my thoughts on this.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I did find buried in the logging already in place another potential issue with SSL connectivitiy. It looked to accept the connection but complained that \"error:140BA0E4:SSL routines:SSL_new:ssl ctx has no default ssl version\". I must not have been setting the default TLS/SSL method for SSL objects newly created from this CTX.\r\n\r\nGonna try adding in \"SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version( m_context, SSLv23_server_method());\" and try and simulate an occurence without an SSL version. Never seen this before. First time for everything. You learn something new everyday. :D\r\n\r\nCiao ... for now.
