I am particularly surprised because you are clearly a very intelligent person, and yet single out a specific book like that, and blindly trust everything in it...  \r\n\r\nTry looking at what the Bible says and evaluating it with the same clarity of mind as you evaluate programming issues (IDisposable for example).  \r\n\r\n\"When you buy a male Hebrew slave, he shall serve for six years, but in the seventh he shall go out a free person, without debt.\" - this is grounded in the Bible (Exodus 21:2). Hope you are at least a little skeptical about this.","postId":"2010_01_best-computer-programming-book-ever-6ef10b20-531c-3e8b-8d99-827eca79a456","replyTo":"","date":"2010-03-03T02:54:00Z","timestamp":1267584840,"authorUserId":""},{"_id":"e193a90b-06aa-3bda-ad9c-f299f14d69bb","authorName":"Stephen Cleary, Nito Programs","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"6d10b20722189b4c5928e1e9fb2363ac","message":"God has proven Himself true over and over again for a couple of decades in my life. Still, there is no way to absolutely prove the entire Bible (if there were, then Christianity - a faith-based system - would cease to exist).  \r\n\r\nAt times, I have doubted the Bible. However, I have always found the Bible to be true, if understood in context.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the Bible does not condone slavery, but does have instructions for how to live in a society where slavery is accepted. In the particular passage you quoted, the instructions are not even dealing with \"slavery\" as we think of it today; the system was more what we would call \"indentured servitude\" (the person in question has sold himself into temporary service to pay off a debt).  \r\n\r\nTrue slavery in the Bible is only found when one nation conquors another and takes slaves (usually from the youth). Even then, it was common practice to practically adopt such slaves, even to the point of making them heirs! Very different than the mental image of \"slavery\" that exists in modern Western culture.","postId":"2010_01_best-computer-programming-book-ever-6ef10b20-531c-3e8b-8d99-827eca79a456","replyTo":"","date":"2010-03-03T16:54:37Z","timestamp":1267635277,"authorUserId":""}]
