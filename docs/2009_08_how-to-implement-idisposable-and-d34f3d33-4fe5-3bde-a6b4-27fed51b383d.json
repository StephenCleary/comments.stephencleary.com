It is almost always, by the definition of exceptions, the wrong thing to do. If you catch an exception, it should be handled. The only case where it shouldn't is a case where exceptions can be thrown for things that aren't actually broken. (Thread.Sleep, for example, can throw a ThreadInterruptedException if someone calls thatThread.Interrupt(). But nothing's actually \"wrong\".) However, cases like that are not that common, and they're usually already handled by the code that needs to handle them. All you're really doing by swallowing exceptions is sweeping errors under the rug and making them that much harder to diagnose and fix.","postId":"2009_08_how-to-implement-idisposable-and-d34f3d33-4fe5-3bde-a6b4-27fed51b383d","replyTo":"","date":"2011-09-20T16:16:17Z","timestamp":1316535377,"authorUserId":""},{"_id":"d72a5cd3-8714-363b-9e08-174b1f1e4ef3","authorName":"Anonymous","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"","message":"What if it's a COM object with a .close method - replace CloseHandle with a simple com_object.close and then Marshal.ReleaseComObject(com_object)?","postId":"2009_08_how-to-implement-idisposable-and-d34f3d33-4fe5-3bde-a6b4-27fed51b383d","replyTo":"","date":"2011-10-17T08:41:41Z","timestamp":1318840901,"authorUserId":""},{"_id":"4a83fecc-bc27-3149-80df-7984b11fb80d","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"aRmSxu+pmOy44oJlyTFIKCcWJojzFy9OZQCdAeWR1ldVgxUTn9XYJ2My4DRHxyog15yfnFta9z8/EMeIfBHjDUxQBgYVXEiTIc3l02/qN+OpSzvh/xPxAQtL3ZmKdAPkZgbXQ3YUWHHTDzlKGLfrP0fclstcpzvppQAlawaYfPOx8JbKrONvXfq13mRhiOijaC0SvJTaIZBekiNL/mvJ/3zd2XPde9BADFdEJBvd5/nVBWgnOFB90TjlUgVOYBtbVfxe9gj5hvyzbnQa+Yj7a5lpmPKitUdfNSzPp6XDmmqm6NTo2zOktspz6/vl9rr+UyWPjjZOJpExx3xkL93xE+Zfj5tS6Enseq/0fa66bpSDzB2dHOFBVWKiyt98EjUD+13v/Du6H3fCrgPDusnehGQvUPnZ5N9kn4+rluj2FSkogRDLERQjujO23o3Y88ZBKp0/rC8H/R6/14KiGDKerU5N1927HHXYmwwQi3HKHODTtGTjJ7MHCOqDCNtpVN6DJMu95yBgKYM3LMPnavdY1dW7UVHjF6PtH51Bi4nRTkH94F1wrx5K70EVh+2fG9B1GNKOxJXXq8XwInaQk707h/ePaJRQ/BpJJAkR8NNPzaA4PSiBGlJWCFOF8mhOAmyjG5czTWrrBV/I8o8nMlSf5dNLVB8j4RJkjgQPrqK8Uo0=","authorEmailMD5":"ad2250182ff26a84dda974e50cd94382","message":"I have very little COM interop experience, but I believe this is correct:  \r\n\r\nA \"Close\" method on a COM object is an actual method, not a generic resource cleanup method (i.e., it actually performs an action; one that you don't necessarily want done in every use case).
