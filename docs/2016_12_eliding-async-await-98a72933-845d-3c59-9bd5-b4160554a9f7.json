For all other exceptions, the only reasonable approach is to place them on the returned task.\r\n\r\nWhether to eagerly throw precondition exceptions depends on your perspective, particularly this:\r\n\r\n> the work represented by the task never gets underway, so I don't really expect the method to return me a task.\r\n\r\nThe work *is* the method itself - that's what the task represents. So, if preconditions are run \"before\" the method (logically, not literally), then yes, it makes sense to want the exception thrown directly. But if preconditions are run at the beginning of the method, then it makes sense to fault the task. Jon Skeet is in the throw-directly camp, but I think it doesn't really matter - either way, precondition violations are boneheaded exceptions and thus shouldn't be caught anyway.","postId":"2016_12_eliding-async-await-98a72933-845d-3c59-9bd5-b4160554a9f7","replyTo":"854b548c-7547-30a3-902a-7a994c520380","date":"2016-12-02T11:11:15Z","timestamp":1480677075},{"_id":"854b548c-7547-30a3-902a-7a994c520380","authorName":"Ian Griffiths","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"8c4da9b88e4f0c290c8441d06d37dfba","authorUri":"http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/","authorUserId":"disqus:ian_griffiths","authorFallbackAvatar":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/ian_griffiths.jpg","message":"You say \"The expected asynchronous semantics are that exceptions are placed on the returned task.\" This surprised me - I would expect it to depend on the nature of the exception.

In my webinars around NServiceBus v6 wich is async from top to bottom I explained another cause why you should always first go with the keywords and then optimize if necessary. The case is when you upgrade existing message handlers you will not forget the await statements when you first mark the handler method async. The compiler guides you then through the process. After you've done that you can look at the code and decide whether it is worth optimizing or not.","postId":"2016_12_eliding-async-await-98a72933-845d-3c59-9bd5-b4160554a9f7","replyTo":"","date":"2016-12-03T12:31:12Z","timestamp":1480768272},{"_id":"5a8f7c36-cd7a-3f40-8e3f-c84e0f1d8a0f","authorName":"Jason Bock","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"078b61f4e6f93716b54bb5fb434c8a60","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"disqus:jason_bock","authorFallbackAvatar":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/jason_bock.jpg","message":"I kind of cringe when you show disposing HttpClient as it's something one should generally not do:\r\n\r\n[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15705092/do-httpclient-and-httpclienthandler-have-to-be-disposed](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15705092/do-httpclient-and-httpclienthandler-have-to-be-disposed)","postId":"2016_12_eliding-async-await-98a72933-845d-3c59-9bd5-b4160554a9f7","replyTo":"","date":"2016-12-16T13:47:15Z","timestamp":1481896035},{"_id":"78a86ac4-941f-35f6-b361-f4620166e04e","authorName":"Ian Griffiths","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"8c4da9b88e4f0c290c8441d06d37dfba","authorUri":"http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/","authorUserId":"disqus:ian_griffiths","authorFallbackAvatar":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/ian_griffiths.jpg","message":"\"The work *is* the method itself - that's what the task represents\"\r\n\r\nI think this is where we disagree. My view has always been that the task represents some work to be done.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's my background in kernel mode device drivers (where everything is async) but the most straightforward view of any async operation to me is some work you've asked to be performed that will take a while to complete.

It represents some work, often I/O-bound, which can be done by something off-CPU, and the Task will be notified when that work completes. That's a completely valid interpretation of Task, and one that is directly applicable when looking at tasks sourced from TaskFactory.FromAsync.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's another interpretation of Task that is equally valid, particularly for tasks returned from methods. When you have an async method, the async state machine creates your Task and controls it for you. As long as the method awaits an (incomplete) awaitable, the task is not completed. When the method finishes, the task is completed. If the method returns a value, then that becomes the tasks's result. If the method throws an exception, then the task is faulted with that exception. In this way, a Task represents the execution of the method.\r\n\r\nBoth interpretations of Task are correct, and both valuable in different contexts. It is the latter version, however, that most end-users are more familiar with. The vast majority of async users have that view, and really have no idea how tasks \"really work\" at the lowest level - they only compose existing tasks into higher-level operations using async/await. All their experience with creating tasks is done via the async state machine. And the expectation from that mindset is that if an API method returns a task, then that task represents the execution of that method (and thus, they expect exceptions to be placed on the task).","postId":"2016_12_eliding-async-await-98a72933-845d-3c59-9bd5-b4160554a9f7","replyTo":"78a86ac4-941f-35f6-b361-f4620166e04e","date":"2016-12-17T14:10:58Z","timestamp":1481983858},{"_id":"ed014c86-172e-3ebe-a17f-92831fe37f2a","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"3db7b6e14d9da42751e4bab03bc4d034","authorUri":"https://stephencleary.com/","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"But: [http://byterot.blogspot.co.uk/2016/07/singleton-httpclient-dns.html](http://byterot.blogspot.co.uk/2016/07/singleton-httpclient-dns.html)\r\n\r\nHowever, I do agree that HttpClient should generally be shared and not disposed; I'll update this post in a bit.","postId":"2016_12_eliding-async-await-98a72933-845d-3c59-9bd5-b4160554a9f7","replyTo":"5a8f7c36-cd7a-3f40-8e3f-c84e0f1d8a0f","date":"2016-12-17T13:50:46Z","timestamp":1481982646},{"_id":"07eaeb3a-ef4c-31cb-a3ed-63c07da8c3f5","authorName":"Thomas Levesque","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"f4acdb91aba11ddf8f03d4b12453f3d5","authorUri":"http://www.thomaslevesque.com/","authorUserId":"disqus:thomaslevesque","authorFallbackAvatar":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/thomaslevesque.jpg","message":"I'll need to check again, but I'm pretty sure I had eliminated inlining as a possible cause.","postId":"2016_12_eliding-async-await-98a72933-845d-3c59-9bd5-b4160554a9f7","replyTo":"f954c4c5-81f3-323f-85d0-944bf0974c6a","date":"2016-12-18T15:29:41Z","timestamp":1482074981},{"_id":"574658c3-dcf2-3c77-b68d-332976ee6abe","authorName":"abatishchev","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"b9da2ca6abf3a1e28fb470f2b3ae2c34","authorUri":"http://abatishchev.ru","authorUserId":"disqus:abatishchev","authorFallbackAvatar":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/abatishchev.jpg","message":"Isn't this because type Task represents both an async I/O and a promise (via ctor accepting a delegate)?

A custom SyncCtx is the only reasonable approach, but it can cause some subtle problems. E.g., there are several (old-school, not Core) ASP.NET APIs that assume SynchronizationContext.Current is AspNetSynchronizationContext, and if it isn't, they silently fail. Which is not so cool. There isn't really anything you can do about that, though.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see this paired with a Roslyn-based compile-time analyzer for deadlock detection.","postId":"2016_12_eliding-async-await-98a72933-845d-3c59-9bd5-b4160554a9f7","replyTo":"69efb794-eb63-31fe-ae5c-de009417c472","date":"2017-01-20T15:16:04Z","timestamp":1484925364},{"_id":"594e37d7-3ae7-39cd-bccb-4b20203763b5","authorName":"Ramon de Klein","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"cc4787d42130bb9cc4070f11470139c4","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"disqus:ramondeklein","authorFallbackAvatar":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/ramondeklein.jpg","message":"Thanks for you feedback, but I am not into Roslyn that much.
