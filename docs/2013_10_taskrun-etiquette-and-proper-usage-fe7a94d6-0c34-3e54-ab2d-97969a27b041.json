Initially, I didn't call the third party services with Javascript but in [vb.net](http://vb.net) as they were actually WCF services. It caused a \"freeze-up\" page.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, I ended up with creating a page method to wrap up the web service calls and using javascript ajax call to invoke my page method.\r\n\r\nFor some reason,WCF proxy doesn't have asynchronous versions.Even if the asynchronous methods were available, I still couldn't use async keyword because the web server only support .net framework 4.0.\r\n\r\nThe code inside the page method looks like this:\r\n\r\nvar data1 = GetData1(); //WCF synchronous call  \r\nvar data2 =GetData2(); //WCF synchronous call  \r\nvar data3 = GetData3(); //WCF synchronous call\r\n\r\nvar aggregation = Aggregate(data1,data2,data3);\r\n\r\nEach WCF synchronous call takes around 10 seconds so the total time adds up to 30 seconds. In order to speed it up, I tried wrapping each call into a Task.Run so that they can run in parallel, thus reducing the total time to around 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nI understand it's far from a perfect solution as each Task.Run takes a thread pool thread that may impact other web applications.

If they are being handled synchronously, and SendAsync is behaving synchronously, then just let that stand. That's usually better than introducing parallelism in an ASP.NET environment.\r\n\r\nBut if that's not acceptable, then I'd use TPL Dataflow here, rather than AsyncBarrier. I'm also not clear on how QBWI comes into play, unless the main operation is fire-and-forget, which sounds dangerous.","postId":"2013_10_taskrun-etiquette-and-proper-usage-fe7a94d6-0c34-3e54-ab2d-97969a27b041","replyTo":"1a2b43f7-c42d-37da-9a5e-3e4da2af94a6","date":"2017-11-29T13:53:41Z","timestamp":1511963621},{"_id":"37ea80db-2310-38ed-bca3-1e1ed36b6213","authorName":"Scott McKay","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"384d2327b00c037623207507e3a14cc7","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_U6noZg42Is","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"It's a low latency service. Letting them run synchronously costs me over 1ms per item in the batch. By firing off the subrequests on separate threads I can complete an entire batch of 50 requests, including a call to an external system, in 10ms total. If I didn't care about the latency I would definitely let it do its own thing. Obviously there's a cost in running more threads though to balance out.\r\n\r\nI'm using QBWI to fire off the subrequests essentially as completely separate requests (an OData batch is just a way to pass multiple standalone requests at once). I wrap that in a TaskCompletionSource so that they're not fire-and-forget, and use Task.WhenAll to await the subrequests completing. I could equally use Task.Run for that, but I thought QBWI was more standard for ASP.NET. I would prefer a bit more control over how many threads were potentially used to process the batch, but I'm avoiding adding that complexity for the moment unless I need it.\r\n\r\nWhilst I run all the subrequests as separate requests, I attach a helper class with the AsyncBarrier to the request properties. When all the subrequests meet the barrier, I combine their info so it's just one call to the external system. I run the subrequests as standalone requests because I need the WebApi OData processing of the request input and formatting of response output that happens when I push them through the non-batch route.\r\n\r\nObviously this is very specific usage in a low latency environment and brings in a few of different considerations.","postId":"2013_10_taskrun-etiquette-and-proper-usage-fe7a94d6-0c34-3e54-ab2d-97969a27b041","replyTo":"1d9750d7-a733-3c8e-8639-c02c3baa6c08","date":"2017-11-29T21:45:55Z","timestamp":1511991955}]
