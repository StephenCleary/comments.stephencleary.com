You speak of whether the object owns or maybe-owns the mutex as to whether that is the test for good code. I call BS on that and charge you with misdirecting a lot of inexperienced programmers.

I never encourage \"if\" statements in Dispose; an object either owns a resource or it does not. It may share an owned resource by owning a reference-counted Disposable, but this is rarely needed).  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, *not* calling Dispose when you *should* can cause some very difficult-to-find bugs. Many classes *require* Dispose to be called, no \"if's\" about it (pardon the pun!).  \r\n\r\nSo I claim the \"if\" check makes the code *less* robust in the face of complex software processes and team maintenance over time.  \r\n\r\nWhat the benefits are of having an \"if\" check?  \r\n1. It does not help when refactoring. Changing resource ownership requires changes to Dispose regardless of whether there's an \"if\" check.  \r\n2. It does not help with robustness. If it actually avoids a null dereference, then you've only introduced a much harder-to-find error by skipping the owned resource's Dispose.   \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I think *not* having an \"if\" check more clearly communicates the designed intent of the code.

Due to slow performance when making the connection, the connection is made once in the constructor and I expose a Disconnect() method that delegates to the api.Disconnect() method.  \r\n\r\nHowever, I cannot be certain that users of my class will always call my Disconnect() method, and I want to make absolutely sure that the connection is closed when my object is disposed/finalized. Even though I do not have unmanaged resources, is this a case where a finalizer (and the full Dispose pattern) is needed? Otherwise how can I ensure the connection is closed and I do not have a leak?  \r\n\r\nMany thanks","postId":"2009_08_second-rule-of-implementing-idisposable-7a1a789c-9a61-3596-ac63-8d78ef6528a5","replyTo":"","date":"2012-04-10T20:53:08Z","timestamp":1334091188},{"_id":"7d481fdf-aebb-345c-a3af-fb46185f9132","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"ad2250182ff26a84dda974e50cd94382","authorUri":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13192873941258824056","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"I would say it depends on whether there is an actual \"leak\" or not. What happens if Disconnect is never called? If the system as a whole recovers from that situation (e.g., the external system will eventually detect the connection is no longer there or just times it out, and if the external system allows other connections from the same source) then it can be treated as a \"managed\" resource - it's inefficient but there's no leak.  \r\n\r\nThat's probably the best way to go, because the system as a whole must be able to recover from connection problems. The only other situation I can think of is if the (client-side) API layer itself has some restriction, like only allowing one connection per process. In that case, I would lean towards putting in a finalizer which actually (intentionally) crashes.","postId":"2009_08_second-rule-of-implementing-idisposable-7a1a789c-9a61-3596-ac63-8d78ef6528a5","replyTo":"","date":"2012-04-14T02:12:19Z","timestamp":1334369539},{"_id":"5be6b65b-6611-3f6d-b839-906d881b4df2","authorName":"Anonymous","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"You're overlooking a possible scenario with your advice to avoid null checks in Dispose().  \r\n\r\nYes, *if* the IDisposable resource is created in the constructor of the class and is never released until the class is ready to be disposed, your approach is fine, because the IDisposable resource is guaranteed to exist when Dispose() is called.  \r\n\r\nHowever, there are cases when that is *not* true, even though the class is still responsible for owning the resource.  \r\n\r\nFor example, if I have a class that can be configured to do something at regular intervals, it may create and own an IDisposable System.Threading.Timer. However, if that functionality is not called into service, the Timer may never be created. Or, maybe it was used at some point in the life of my class but turned off later. In either case, the Timer object is not guaranteed to exist when Dispose() is called; therefore a null check is required in Dispose().  \r\n\r\nAnother scenario might be when an exception is thrown while attempting to instantiate an IDisposable resource. The resource was not created successfully, so it will be null when Dispose() is called on the owning class. There may be other IDisposable resources besides that one that need to be cleaned up, though.  \r\n\r\nIn short, it is possible (and in my experience, somewhat common) that even though a class may own an IDisposable resource if it exists, it is not guaranteed to exist when Dispose() is called. Therefore, a null check is required in Dispose() to avoid an exception in Dispose().","postId":"2009_08_second-rule-of-implementing-idisposable-7a1a789c-9a61-3596-ac63-8d78ef6528a5","replyTo":"","date":"2012-05-26T02:27:26Z","timestamp":1337999246},{"_id":"ab8c914f-77e0-364c-9ac2-f51a862ab217","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"ad2250182ff26a84dda974e50cd94382","authorUri":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/13192873941258824056","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"No, you should NOT call Dispose in your destructor/finalizer.  \r\n\r\nIn the context of this blog post, the objects in question only have managed resources, not unmanaged resources.
