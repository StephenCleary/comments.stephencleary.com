ExpectedExceptionAttribute isn't a good solution here, or anywhere.  \r\nThe issue with unwrapping the AggregateException again isn't anything to do with async, it's just that ExpectedException doesn't allow you to verify the InnerException. Just write a helper function to catch the exception for you, and then verify it properly using normal asserts!.","postId":"2012_02_async-unit-tests-part-1-wrong-way-36b6b297-8f03-3340-b0a6-10e349ad0849","replyTo":"","date":"2013-01-14T07:42:32Z","timestamp":1358149352,"authorUserId":""},{"_id":"a8f2496e-33e7-36ec-bb0c-f128aae9f846","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"ad2250182ff26a84dda974e50cd94382","message":"At the time this blog post was written (when only VS2010 had been released), \"async Task\" was not an option for unit tests. BTW, it is possible to provide a context for async void methods and both wait for them and retrieve their exceptions; this is how nUnit supports async void unit tests.  \r\n\r\nI agree with your comment re ExpectedExceptionAttribute. I use and recommend a ThrowsAsync method for checking exceptions on async methods. I used ExpectedExceptionAttribute examples in this blog post because that's Microsoft's recommendation and the approach most MSTest users are familiar with.","postId":"2012_02_async-unit-tests-part-1-wrong-way-36b6b297-8f03-3340-b0a6-10e349ad0849","replyTo":"","date":"2013-01-14T17:55:25Z","timestamp":1358186125,"authorUserId":""},{"_id":"54131b57-6e48-347a-a065-b565d4341459","authorName":"Dave Schinkel","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"","message":"Not coding without tests is NOT extreme.

I read that blog post about a year ago.  \r\n\r\nThere are certain types of code such as domain objects and business rules that are very amenable to tests and are ideal for test-driven development. I would go so far as to say that there are entire applications (probably a majority of applications) that can be developed using TDD.  \r\n\r\nHowever, there are also other types of code such as low-level synchronization libraries that cannot be fully developed using test-driven development; at some point a deep understanding of race conditions and other multithreading concerns *must* guide the code development. TDD alone and unguided would result in subtle bugs.","postId":"2012_02_async-unit-tests-part-1-wrong-way-36b6b297-8f03-3340-b0a6-10e349ad0849","replyTo":"","date":"2014-04-21T05:52:14Z","timestamp":1398059534,"authorUserId":""},{"_id":"0816457d-1ebf-3136-b0d3-0c806cc18fec","authorName":"Dustin","authorEmailEncrypted":"ipOHCyGOzLCJd1z6bojOkPhL4KLjW7CzTu0jIbCumUdfFgfhe+K/PKjwOe62iqocZhqnWAsbFDloqZGC/U8aE78GivYND66pHnPWcMR1teTgwgtY0n02fYPB9+m8zp9rH0PDNRS5PItkQFkp5k+SKjNe3bCvbqrW0WCbyGyGsPLKVenSmFMpZB/h4kRwxX0yR5EWLkfJnEOsL+V7KU2yszfzvM5wFcVL/svrLAUvcl4HS+MnKVSVLrBg+jQKZeZIv8Wa/F9RAq742UTwR/T0eHPz327Xf9big/uzUqLoLZMitNY7OqbP2Pdl8k2kOErrnJ5SRvPnaM77JXFo3iHxKhhu13p6dMweWFvk3iz6i58+ahIK3gd07JJP4mOPubuLAdit9s3jVHEcyteOlBKVfWetsyMOQHJDUObtlVbK9EDOFPTPmEx9j+GGmI5bKs2N9wTOBWS+WaROtTdREEq2bWIbuqfS5Du6FftcFjhA85Yk2WWL9dnFgPr7ZqkNhxAYvV3c/vqXVLT5glQRtwAMorgU2uo95InwRKSHJEqlTXamhbWAtsUEYM2g39vHFXEqMRnZOB5HiSPBv40Zu1gc0KLwlXMNmI/feTnbUaImE76hqQlDpTyL8rXL+3/ETcTqVS4K2mEkVUUDlU3LJ2xNjc1AKm137k9/3Tt0OdYt7B4=","authorEmailMD5":"4071a791320e2c575e7e28323de11909","message":"Xamarin.iOS 7.2 release notes indicates async Test support: [http://developer.xamarin.com/releases/ios/xamarin.ios_7/xamarin.ios_7.2/](http://developer.xamarin.com/releases/ios/xamarin.ios_7/xamarin.ios_7.2/)\r\n\r\nJust tested this myself and I can now await things inside of a test case.","postId":"2012_02_async-unit-tests-part-1-wrong-way-36b6b297-8f03-3340-b0a6-10e349ad0849","replyTo":"","date":"2014-12-08T16:59:39Z","timestamp":1418057979,"authorUserId":""},{"_id":"46939aa1-12d7-30ad-9a30-da21f50cceb7","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"ad2250182ff26a84dda974e50cd94382","message":"Good!
