It *might* work to reuse the same instance, but AFAIK it's not guaranteed; the standard error handling response for any kind of error is to immediately Close the socket, and I would apply that same logic to the connecting socket.","postId":"2009_05_error-handling-dd64acf2-8f2e-3f79-826f-43e4b6bae3c3","replyTo":"c43043d0-86cf-3f79-aed6-0780c8c35d68","date":"2014-08-13T15:42:11Z","timestamp":1407944531},{"_id":"c43043d0-86cf-3f79-aed6-0780c8c35d68","authorName":"Guillaume","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"3728e6f4a8b547f08329628b1320b3e2","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"This seems like a mandatory complement to the MSDN documentation.
