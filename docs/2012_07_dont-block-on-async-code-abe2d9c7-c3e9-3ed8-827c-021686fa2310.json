It saved me a very long investigation, I believe.  \r\n\r\nI just have on small question. What does it mean, for the asynchronous call, to not collect the synchronization context?   \r\n\r\nIn my case, I'm in the opposite situation. I got an In-Memory WebAPI server, which I call from a long stack of non-async methods, which in turns is called by MVC (don't ask me why a MVC server would send a request to an In-Memory WebAPI server, I feel we would drift away ;) ). The non-async method waits for the response of the call to the SendRequestAsync of the in-memory server, and in a MVC context, it's the deadlock.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, I either have to change all that stack to make it async (and I don't even know if that's possible), or to simply drop the synchronization context capture from the In-Memory WebAPI server, using Configure Await.  \r\n\r\nI assume there are some data that would not be available anymore? What's the con, what would I loose?  \r\n\r\nThanks a lot.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2013-08-22T11:46:01Z","timestamp":1377171961,"authorUserId":""},{"_id":"35191810-a26e-3238-8b06-25a7c5134b12","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"bJ/yFnKkMOAxyR+wnmgWne2CmnBinymG6ONb6Bq8vVyk8dOuDW+Br6QgqP68wTAcgc1FZsuVUSMua7422/uDVk1SlICbeyOUaUnWoFA9WzM3UpqoLH9MPL8DXogahvb5qwsOa/bGCzaCp6wayxoSIg3Y8G6PYGAc61xeYUu3Ufnlj5XdxKeSIjWKNYl1VpWsgoOBRVUz5F3+SRTRm9usQZRwoD0X3o8jNh84X62FJc6ciF+Zdr3AKpRvoxtsFB8dDH7qxjQ9Trh6Pc2XNyqstihHbYLr5BnRGX4JvbPWeCZukVJaoHej4BJwWmN4ur9caMjMOBZd4wgAqr9QiBGbHNfwPhtxKrpEL/LqxjJovo3NTqz4nqqr1Fobxb3bvfBFjejxMz2mgYrLWdKXiX9SRv2NR7iOoWXhEdsYBhWzV5bz2LoD8oZY/Gw8xw+pbvebkMq9LEMVIMRRXAYxkbUmQQXbwVamR05C0eqKFklatH4N2oo2FAKYNFZZwfDzASUXDGJTyS0JHAJq0OdI0r1rU8Furo7j8S28n40/8MCSz9NyWyNtrVa4EIiw+5mW5zz9tbnvat+om9Hm3i30STi8Q5J6FuY4B+Qq9Uf0dYVS6ZkylYWbTS/0BJOhLe137kH83XL82e0VjcEXzLvY0vltXZtxxKG+fWgaUrrgwtYSGY0=","authorEmailMD5":"ad2250182ff26a84dda974e50cd94382","message":"I assume you mean WCF instead of MVC.

To make sure it's nothing else in my application I've isolated the problem to the simplest code possible. The inner API is very simple (created from wizard):\r\n\r\n``\r\n\r\nThe outer API just calls the inner one and adds another item to the list:\r\n\r\n``\r\n\r\nNothing fancy so far. I thought I did the async/await handling correctly. The point is it begins to choke when I try to make 10 hits to the outer API at a time. I'm using Fiddler for that and for the inner API it works flawlessly even with 1000 requests at once. For the outer API which is calling the inner API under the hood it goes flawlessly for about 5 requests. For 10 (or more) at a time all of them stuck for about 100 seconds and then fail (sometimes all of them, sometimes only a part). Those which fail do not return any response (*[Fiddler] ReadResponse() failed: The server did not return a response for this request. Server returned 0 bytes.*)  \r\nI've already tried with single instance of HttpClient, but with no luck. Any idea what could be the problem? When I do the same from console app (multiple HttpClient calls in parallel to the inner API) then it works fine, so I guess it has something to do with thread pools being used by ASP.NET. I've also tried to reproduce the problem on a different machine and it's the same. In case anyone wants to try, here is the source code: [http://www.fidek.org/WebAPI-HttpClient.zip](http://www.fidek.org/WebAPI-HttpClient.zip) It's a test project, the url is hardcoded, so you need to modify it to your needs. Just call the outer API multiple times at once (Shift-R in Fiddler on the request - easy way to replay it given times) and see what happens.   \r\nAny help appreciated, I'm struggling with this for a day and can't find a solution...","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2014-10-30T12:38:20Z","timestamp":1414672700,"authorUserId":"disqus:ireneusz_patalas"},{"_id":"2a6b4f1b-ebea-39d6-8d9c-4ec8e9349d90","authorName":"Ireneusz Patalas","authorEmailEncrypted":"Te3diKsnpuweKomS9kjRP2DJGX8WVwM+PvRexBhhYoMB3e1sozIukeLxKJx+HPwY3TgBBEqGPjO2CjIqszNCUhVMu6qMB3Zafe+r9wc57oQ1rUVA+Y1NTc+q+KUx8XQqEBSSTCL/8R1hW+ojLlZBlIytiiDnizep/hzseGcN8xuU0611l3CVjH5Trd/zxgNhn+AE/6DrJuIc4qjI/GxXMbc2eNNkfUqf2RE7yC9B3iSKTMmck7mGP1DfuByCTonXODHS9B/1mSRqRyU51A7wCpMBMMAGLnACkGkJ7glQOsfJnleHtviIVBNpO3XDrUDiZEXlSjGVDWVqxt/TifvH1a2X3LwIPLb5/B3FVgd75ObLipB/w55zW7wYG7Ap23+TD8AvDPYi8T/66snkm3+QoazolLHcjcIv9gTLrAU7cL4k/kols/RMolRPFMLAdnDBVvESWh4M6HprR4/AkMEZDWadR2pAVYFFE4KKHBKETWkMXPqxIAwLQdF7QwV3Z/p4MGEzNnSug6x8/ULlTiXaQChNSIfvvzJ2gDq819mbybXj4HrxOmBz9rPuoc3i3aAXJxYASgv73/kN8SVshDls97gIKFOgO5ZhYDa8WxRfiU33EJNrPO7NTHDZ1ZWMPeHs8W7LI9HdfiJiAbYhmlFvwNNLaztizQkGosQ3HtqglSQ=","authorEmailMD5":"3892e1206cca25d573ebb7cd198d6a69","message":"Ok, so I'm gonna answer myself :)   \r\nI found the problem by accident.

A \"session\" is shared between the requests, and (by default) each request will want read/write access to the session state. This is what causes all the requests to wait for each other - because they each want that write lock. To work around this, disable session state whenever possible; i.e., apply [SessionState(SessionStateBehavior.Disabled)] or [SessionState(SessionStateBehavior.ReadOnly)] to your controllers.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"afcdbab2-aeaa-3ce6-b8df-bc9876183b86","date":"2015-01-22T18:07:20Z","timestamp":1421950040,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"},{"_id":"afcdbab2-aeaa-3ce6-b8df-bc9876183b86","authorName":"Cherie","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"e0d78c9fad417af042647d56544078ee","message":"Thank you so very much for the post!!!  \r\nI have question about SynchronizationContext.

At the *very least*, it *must* be applied at the first await *that yields* in every async method. The problem is that it's difficult to know whether the first await will always yield or not. E.g., if the first await in your async method is a call to SignalR, you'd think that would always yield, but it may not - there are exceptions that can be thrown *synchronously*, which means that first await wouldn't yield, which means you'd end up with a deadlock unless you have ConfigureAwait(false) on the *next* await in that method. So this is why it's best to put ConfigureAwait(false) *everywhere*.

It only deadlocks if the calling code is in a context, the task needs to sync to that context to complete, and that context only allows one thread at a time.\r\n\r\nIf the calling code isn't in a context (i.e., it's in a Console app or a contextless thread pool thread), then it won't block that context.\r\n\r\nIf the task doesn't need to sync to that context (i.e., it uses ConfigureAwait(false) all the way through), then it won't need to enter that context to complete.\r\n\r\nIf the context allows multiple threads (i.e., a custom context, or a limited concurrency context that permits multiple threads), then the calling code blocking in the context won't prevent the task from entering the context. This is extremely uncommon, especially for asynchronous code.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do strongly recommend against using the Result property for asynchronous code, because both of the common conditions can easily change.\r\n\r\nAsynchronous code running on a Console app is usually proof-of-concept code that is later put into a UI or ASP.NET application, where it suddenly *is* called from a context. Asynchronous code running in a contextless thread pool thread is usually in the middle of being refactored from threaded to asynchronous, to run on the UI or ASP.NET request thread.\r\n\r\nDepending on all the asynchronous code using ConfigureAwait(false) is dangerous. If one of them is missed, then it's possible to have a race condition where sometimes the context is avoided and sometimes it's not. This is easy to miss even for experienced developers. It also assumes that all your libraries fully use ConfigureAwait(false) properly, which, again, is easy to miss. Note that even the common and excellent HttpClient library has some platforms where they missed this.\r\n\r\nSo, I always recommend against Result in asynchronous code, unless it absolutely cannot be avoided (e.g., the Main method of Console apps). Even if Result doesn't deadlock, it will wrap exceptions in AggregateException, so even in the rare cases where it's needed, I'd say to use GetAwaiter().GetResult() instead.\r\n\r\nI've written more about Result and other ways to retrieve results here: [http://blog.stephencleary.com/2014/12/a-tour-of-task-part-6-results.html](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2014/12/a-tour-of-task-part-6-results.html)\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n***If*** you're writing Dynamic Task-Based Parallel code ([https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Ff963551.aspx)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Ff963551.aspx)) (which is very advanced), then using Result is appropriate.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"c49570dd-ae97-3846-aff1-423b4651f05c","date":"2015-09-08T12:56:48Z","timestamp":1441717008,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"},{"_id":"c49570dd-ae97-3846-aff1-423b4651f05c","authorName":"Bilal Fazlani","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"329381200b3974c701e3a84cdbf3a440","message":"So according to this article, we can never use Task.Result property ?, if we use, it will always end up in deadlock ?","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2015-09-08T10:58:59Z","timestamp":1441709939,"authorUserId":"disqus:bilalfazlani"},{"_id":"e59b81ae-8886-31d0-941d-c85c6f819a4a","authorName":"Thomas Eyde","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"459097b9ced4413093907cbbcbcab2e8","message":"I have an issue with ConfigureAwait().

It would have been so much better if I got an exception telling me to run that async call on a different thread, or if the runtime just did it.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"44e38063-900c-34eb-b8c3-4865de7b26ce","date":"2015-09-17T12:47:55Z","timestamp":1442494075,"authorUserId":"disqus:thomaseyde"},{"_id":"e452b4ee-6fde-3a12-abe9-23c532f75500","authorName":"Bilal Fazlani","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"329381200b3974c701e3a84cdbf3a440","message":"Thanks Stephen. that was a very detailed response i must say. :)","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"b8b80388-cfbb-3b50-a6c4-cabc282ebc96","date":"2015-09-24T12:52:46Z","timestamp":1443099166,"authorUserId":"disqus:bilalfazlani"},{"_id":"6811cb55-f3cd-37a9-80fd-bc08f4731bef","authorName":"Greg Benedict","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"20f5a99e420216df3537f059481fb1a3","message":"Great post.\r\n\r\nIt always frustrates me that all the simple function example usages out there miss out things like this; I found, and tried 3 different exampels of HttpClient GET functions, all of which displayed this issue, not that I knew it until I found this post.\r\n\r\nThanks","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2015-10-05T13:31:04Z","timestamp":1444051864,"authorUserId":"disqus:greg_benedict"},{"_id":"1fd877bd-6ec9-32d4-8c11-e21f10018d21","authorName":"jeremiah johnson","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"54c3a69343a951a798a6c436ac66bc7f","message":"Why is teaching this so hard?

I haven't been getting a lot of sleep due to a newborn in the house...\r\n\r\nThat said, I do disagree. Well, I mean that I agree that async/await is definitely hard to get your mind around at first. But if you follow some basic rules (like not blocking on async code), you avoid most of the pitfalls. If you start with my async intro ( [http://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html) ) and followup with my async best practices ( [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj991977.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj991977.aspx) ), that should give you a pretty good grounding.\r\n\r\nWhether threads are easier or not is up for a bit of debate. I think it's actually a lot easier to shoot yourself in the foot with plain threads. I suspect that you've learned all the problems with threads already (like figuring out when you need locks, when not to set thread priorities, how threads affect shutdown, and establishing lock hierarchies), so threads seem easier to you. And there's definitely a *lot* more information about threads available than async, and (at this point in time) most of it is good info.\r\n\r\nBut I think once you get a good handle on async/await, you'll find it easier than threads. (Technically, async/await doesn't solve problems in the same way as threads at all; especially on server-side code, async is actually the *opposite* of multithreading). At this point in .NET development, threads are practically obsolete. This is why in my book on concurrency I chose not to cover threads *at all*; the concept of threads is described as necessary in the sections on parallelism (which uses TPL / Parallel LINQ instead of plain threads).\r\n\r\nAlso, async/await is in the process of taking over the world. I'm actually writing a talk to be presented at CodeMash on this exact topic. Python, Dart, TypeScript, and even PHP (Hack) already have it. Scala, JavaScript, and C++ are planning to add it (or at least considering it - not sure about the C++ proposal). I'm afraid there is no escape, even if you switch languages (cue evil laugh).","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"146625ec-e9c1-392e-b5d0-5c2c0b5c2414","date":"2015-10-28T12:47:34Z","timestamp":1446036454,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"},{"_id":"146625ec-e9c1-392e-b5d0-5c2c0b5c2414","authorName":"jeremiah johnson","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"54c3a69343a951a798a6c436ac66bc7f","message":"Well, clearly this is all very easy for you, and that's awesome.

C# has a fair amount of this. But I disagree that async/await is an example of this. :)\r\n\r\nI think the primary difference in reasoning is that async/await has nothing to do with threads. Using async/await to, e.g., download a file, is *completely different* than spinning up a thread to download the file. It's because of this fundamental difference that you have to use async/await all the way. (The MSDN example doesn't deadlock if you call it with `await`).\r\n\r\nOn a side note, the new async/await can work fine alongside threading. If you want to download a file with a thread, you can just do `Task.Run(() => DownloadFile());` - and then you can block on it if you really want to (I can't say I recommend that, though).\r\n\r\nAlso, it is possible to use callbacks with tasks (Continuation Passing Style). You can attach callbacks to the Task object by using ContinueWith. This is essentially what await is doing under the covers (wiring up the \"remainder\" of the method as a continuation of the task). After writing much asynchronous code, I can say with confidence that the async/await approach results in cleaner code than callbacks. This is why languages currently using CPS are moving to async/await (including JavaScript and TypeScript).","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"80339fa2-ba0f-3128-bee5-6225eb28cf31","date":"2015-10-29T13:57:18Z","timestamp":1446127038,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"},{"_id":"80339fa2-ba0f-3128-bee5-6225eb28cf31","authorName":"jeremiah johnson","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"54c3a69343a951a798a6c436ac66bc7f","message":"And I apologize that I was a bit offensive (in that I was on the offensive when I posted.)\r\n\r\nI agree that asynchronous design is the way of the future, and a better way to develop in general, but I disagree that the async & await keywords are the best way to go about it (if that's actually what you meant.)\r\n\r\nI absolutely love how JS, TypeScript, and (I think) any other functional language handle it, and possibly even languages with event support, which include C#.\r\n\r\nI would much rather spawn a thread, then fire an event or call a function upon completion or status update than use async and await. I just hate how async was done in C#. And I hate that it's the only asynchronous paradigm allowed in the UWP APIs.\r\n\r\nAfter reading a few blog posts like yours on this (now that I know what to look for) the solution isn't going to be so hard for me to find in the future, which is nice. It simply reeks of bad language design when the clear-cut, bare minimum await & async example that MS publishes freaking deadlocks when run from a GUI. That is ... well, like I said, this is one of those stretch marks you see when a language gets too big or starts doing things poorly; it's evidence of a fundamental design flaw in the language.\r\n\r\nIt's like how cracks in a wall (which are an easy thing to cover up) point to a building foundation that is not as sound as it should be.\r\n\r\nProgramming languages should not get in the way of the programmer. They should not interfere with the programmer's intent. As a programmer/developer, any language whose syntax is not well defined enough that ambiguity is *introduced* when I type in the code, is a language whose design is probably fundamentally flawed. Sadly I can't think of a programming language that is not fundamentally flawed in this way. There are probably a few out there, but I don't know of them.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"11a5ad5a-a039-373a-95ea-9cb7d8cb8d08","date":"2015-10-29T13:38:54Z","timestamp":1446125934,"authorUserId":"disqus:naikrovek"},{"_id":"2a770dc0-cf21-352a-b17b-8ecaf9241d1a","authorName":"Erwin M","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"92a359c378b8045bd801c715630dac42","message":"Extremely helpful, thanks a lot!","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2015-10-30T08:41:39Z","timestamp":1446194499,"authorUserId":"disqus:mayerwin"},{"_id":"50f7875b-ef7e-3516-b4a5-2ba91aaf283a","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"ad2250182ff26a84dda974e50cd94382","message":"Hi, Piet,\r\n\r\nThere isn't enough information in the question to be able to answer it.

And I can do all this without needing to use ConfigureAwait(false) and also without triggering a Deadlock.\r\n\r\nHave I got that right?","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2016-05-14T09:42:01Z","timestamp":1463218921,"authorUserId":"disqus:Brondahl"},{"_id":"9cc3a836-07d2-3147-ae06-57507b5b8463","authorName":"Luís Fernandes","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"3587d6e1f69adc340c89c46d11a95038","message":"Good afternoon!\r\n\r\nDid you ever have a problem with client.GetAsync() when the host is unreachable? In my case, the client.Timeout goes up to 3 minutes and only then throws a System.Net.WebException - Connection timed out - as described in my post at StackOverflow ([http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37369180/async-download-and-deserialize)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37369180/async-download-and-deserialize)) .\r\n\r\nI tried to base myself in some of your book recommendations, namely 2.1 - Pausing for a Period of Time - Discussion, where you say that CancellationToken is usually a better choice for a timeout; and 9.3 - Canceling Due to Timeouts - Solution, where you show some token timeout examples. However, the CancellingToken is being ignored when the host is unreachable; works fine otherwise (i.e., if the whole download and deserialization process isn't completed in 10 seconds). Still, the (real) problem seems to be in GetAsync method.\r\n\r\nMind to take a look? Thanks!

It sounds like you may be missing an await in your calling code. Every task returned by any methods in your code should be awaited at some point - if you find one that's not, then that's probably your problem.

Making database access async is more debatable - it's only really helpful if the database can scale. But you can generally assume HTTP servers can scale.\r\n\r\n> Is it bad to have any blocking io in an async method?\r\n\r\nIt's not too bad; I cover this in a blog post here: [http://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/11/taskrun-etiquette-examples-even-in.html](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/11/taskrun-etiquette-examples-even-in.html)\r\n\r\nI would say just add a comment to your method stating that it has some blocking in it as well as async code.

I'm looking into solutions for httprequest-level caching in our Web.API project, and HttpContext.Items seems like a decent place for per-request caching.

It has purpose, and the purpose is not 'swiss knife', I'm sure you know that. Deadlock in your example happens not because of missing ConfigureAwait(false), but because both examples are based on application types where synchronization context is allowed to be accessed only by one thread, instead of any (e.g, as with console apps). If you write your 'deadlock' code for console app, the deadlock will not happen. ConfigureAwait is not relevant to the problem, and it's just distracting in this context. If it was relevant, the code without deadlock would not work without ConfigureAwait, but it works.  \r\nConfigureAwait should not be used blindly everywhere. It should only be used in the UI layers of applications, where you want to have access to the synchronization context once the await is over. If you are writing a class library used in both UI and non-UI applications, you should not be concerned with ConfigureAwait inside the library, but only outside.   \r\nThat is the proper explanation in my opinion.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2017-01-25T15:00:28Z","timestamp":1485356428,"authorUserId":"disqus:tengiztutisani"},{"_id":"ff5f686b-c6cf-3c0a-af10-197889527b8a","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"ad2250182ff26a84dda974e50cd94382","message":"I don't think ConfigureAwait(false) should be used everywhere. It should only be used in methods that do not need to resume on their calling context.\r\n\r\nThere are two components to this deadlock. The SynchronizationContext is one component; the async method resuming on a one-thread-at-a-time context is the other. If you remove either, there is no deadlock. Real-world UI or ASP.NET applications cannot just decide to be Console applications instead, so \"make it a Console app\" is not a realistic way to avoid the deadlock. That leaves the other part of the deadlock - the async capturing of the context - which is avoided by ConfigureAwait(false).\r\n\r\nSince the default behavior of await is equivalent to ConfigureAwait(true), it doesn't make sense to only apply ConfigureAwait(true) to a UI layer. You can just use the default behavior.\r\n\r\nRegarding \"If you are writing a class library used in both UI and non-UI applications, you should not be concerned with ConfigureAwait inside the library, but only outside.\" - that is not actually possible. It would be nice if it was, but it's not. If you're going to use ConfigureAwait(false), then every method you call should also use ConfigureAwait(false).\r\n\r\nThink of it this way: if some code calls a library method like this: `await FuncAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);`, this is roughly equivalent to `var task = FuncAsync(); await task.ConfigureAwait(false);`. So `FuncAsync` has already been called, it has already executed to its first `await`, and it has already captured the context before it returns its task, and before the calling code executes `ConfigureAwait(false)`. It's too late at that point.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"dd990e1e-dbbd-3904-bd06-999567348960","date":"2017-01-25T17:46:56Z","timestamp":1485366416,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"},{"_id":"4dbaaae2-a781-39c3-b6d1-5cb244da1a3b","authorName":"Tengiz Tutisani","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"0c38a91503d5685bbee3b370fbe8827a","message":"\"If you're going to use ConfigureAwait(false), then every method you call should also use ConfigureAwait(false).\" - you lost me there.  \r\nI'm not quite following, why would you want every called method to do what you (as a caller) do? every method decides what it wants to have when await resumes, that's the exact purpose of ConfigureAwait() method.  \r\ne.g. if we have chain of all async methods calling each other: controller action A calling method B calling method C calling some operation D (A -> B -> C -> D), then A can decide that it does not need context after resuming, so it will say ConfigureAwait(false); then B can decide that it needs context so it will say ConfigureAwait(true); then C can decide it does not need so it will say ConfigureAwait(false). As a result, only B will resume on the very original context, while both A and C will not.   \r\nWhat exact problem do you see in this scenario? is it not how you would expect it to work? it completely meets my intuitive expectations. Every method makes its own decision whether it needs a context or not.  \r\nYes, by default you will get the same context, but who cares? defaults are just a question of taste. Every method in the call stack still has its own right to choose, regardless of all the other methods before or after on the same call stack.  \r\nI hope you see my point.\r\n\r\nHowever, I must say that if default was false, that would make things simpler, only when combining it with Task. Everything else about ConfigureAwait works just fine. It's just annoying that the default behavior creates the deadlock, so you'd need to explicitly opt out in the library code. That part I agree. I guess Microsoft didn't consider this combination scenario very well.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"ff5f686b-c6cf-3c0a-af10-197889527b8a","date":"2017-01-26T02:46:18Z","timestamp":1485398778,"authorUserId":"disqus:tengiztutisani"},{"_id":"73a82c1d-4016-36bb-8125-9431e3997178","authorName":"ayman metwally","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"424e448aee11240309cca7b0023de2cb","message":"Thanks for the great article.  \r\nFor the 2nd approach:\r\n\r\nDo I also need to add ConfigureAwait(false) to the \"top-level\" method like this:\r\n\r\nvar json = await GetJsonAsync(...).ConfigureAwait(false);\r\n\r\nThanks","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2017-01-28T22:07:55Z","timestamp":1485641275,"authorUserId":"disqus:ayman_metwally"},{"_id":"012ce9d3-7f04-3f85-925a-314dd68fd35f","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"ad2250182ff26a84dda974e50cd94382","message":"Yes.

I'm trying to implement IEnlistmentNotification for a custom Azure provider but I'm a bit stumped on how to properly handle async calls. In essence, I want to make calls to azure storage using the async library calls but that means I have to 'await' somewhere and that is the issue.\r\n\r\nThe IEnlistmentNotification interface defines 'void' methods so I can't 'await' any of the calls I need to make to azure. Sure, I can switch everything to be synchronous, but boy that really stinks that I will lose the power of async in this scenario.\r\n\r\nI have tried googling/SO'ing, but save a few articles I saw that didn't really help, there is shockingly little information on IEnlistmentNotification with async/await.\r\n\r\nGot any ideas for me to research?","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2017-04-25T15:29:06Z","timestamp":1493134146,"authorUserId":""},{"_id":"45607648-bb68-30cd-9985-520d1dead670","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"ad2250182ff26a84dda974e50cd94382","message":"I'm not following the logic here.

We need to move past all of this context sensitive execution modeling.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"1c978b71-601c-3295-9736-e482ad3a1ae7","date":"2017-09-18T18:17:41Z","timestamp":1505758661,"authorUserId":"disqus:greggwon"},{"_id":"37b75eff-273e-3e81-b8bf-95c1edc5fc06","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"ad2250182ff26a84dda974e50cd94382","message":"ASP.NET Core does not have a SynchronizationContext: [https://blog.stephencleary.com/2017/03/aspnetcore-synchronization-context.html](https://blog.stephencleary.com/2017/03/aspnetcore-synchronization-context.html)","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"2490bea3-46b3-32ac-b94a-befeada7ffd2","date":"2017-10-04T16:03:03Z","timestamp":1507132983,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"},{"_id":"38db96ed-8d0d-3883-b5a2-29a51bf43f39","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"ad2250182ff26a84dda974e50cd94382","message":"I don't see anything obviously wrong with that code sample.\r\n\r\nI recommend that you reduce it to the minimal code that causes the problem and post it in a question on Stack Overflow.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"58fdcd04-b518-3b44-bd61-6bc5bbcb89f1","date":"2017-10-04T16:04:49Z","timestamp":1507133089,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"},{"_id":"a5bb857d-c4a2-380e-8549-c05c4bbbd561","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"ad2250182ff26a84dda974e50cd94382","message":"Yes, every method makes its own decision.

I apologize in advance in case I have misinterpreted anything regarding your answer. But first some background on why I'm probing into all this:\r\n\r\nAccording to the repository pattern there shouldn't be leaks of references of any kind (IQueryable, db-related-exceptions) to the upper-level layers (mvc-controllers in my case). I thus tried to find a way to \"materialize\" the result of the queries inside my services so that the \"materialization\" won't happen inside my mvc-controllers. At least that was the only approach I could come up with -given my limited knowledge in all things async- to force db-related exceptions to be thrown->intercepted->wrapped-into-my-own-exceptions and propagated in a sanitized fashion to the upper-layers (mvc-controllers).\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell I'm trying to sync-call async-repository-methods so that I can intercept any db-exceptions in the lower rather than the upper layers. The above snippet was one of the techniques I tested. If you are aware of a better approach to achieve the desired effect with an alternative technique -one that is clean and performs well- please feel free to link resources that point to it for me to study.\r\n\r\nBecause, even though things worked in my dev-machine there was a lingering suspicion in my mind that the approach shown in the snippet might lead to obscure deadlocks in production environments:\r\n\r\nBased on your answer I surmise -and I'ld be happy to stand corrected if I've interpreted your answer the wrong way- that whether a deadlock does occur in [asp.net](http://asp.net), depends on how the Async methods involved are implemented internally. In other words 'FirstOrDefaultAsync()' might not be plagued with the shortcomings of 'GetStringAsync()'.\r\n\r\nin practice how can a dev tell when he's dealing with a \"plagued\" async method like \"GetStringAsync()\" that can cause the dreaded deadlocks?\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote: I studied the linked material\r\n\r\n[https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pfxteam/2012/04/13/should-i-expose-synchronous-wrappers-for-asynchronous-methods/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pfxteam/2012/04/13/should-i-expose-synchronous-wrappers-for-asynchronous-methods/)\r\n\r\nAnd the author gives the following example:\r\n\r\n public TResult Foo(…) => FooAsync(…).Result;\r\n\r\nwhich -at least to my novice eyes- looks very similar to the code I'm field-testing. The author then proceeds to explain that this can deadlock. The author speaks generically as if it doesn't matter whether FooAsync() is an EF method or whether it is being invoked from an ASP.NET controller-action or not. I guess I'm missing something here. This particular aspect makes me feel so conflicted about all this deadlock issue.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"fac220eb-d9c7-32a0-84b1-73be101ad75d","date":"2017-10-16T23:32:01Z","timestamp":1508196721,"authorUserId":"disqus:xdisruptor"},{"_id":"42368e06-b678-3294-afc0-b4eaf064b425","authorName":"x Disruptor","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"ad46e1336e43614ea24e0f42b9a383af","message":"Thank you for the wonderful insight on the subtleties of using async/await.

Just use try/catch exactly like you normally would and use await to call your asynchronous APIs, and it will all work fine.\r\n\r\n> in practice how can a dev tell when he's dealing with a \"plagued\" async method like \"GetStringAsync()\" that can cause the dreaded deadlocks?\r\n\r\nThere is no way to know, short of inspecting the actual source code. This is one reason why I do not recommend depending on code not to deadlock. OK, it works today, but what about in the next version? Or on a different platform (HttpClient is an interesting use case where it never deadlocks on desktop but it can on Windows Phone)? Or in a different scenario (e.g., cached responses returned synchronously can cause the code to take a different execution path)?\r\n\r\nIt's far better to avoid doing sync-over-async in the first place. That way you have code that will always work.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"2ec2bd25-6238-35df-9e9f-dcfda1b58f6a","date":"2017-10-18T01:29:32Z","timestamp":1508290172,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"},{"_id":"dddb43ef-29c5-3993-83c1-37d6981913c7","authorName":"Nyagaka Enock","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"ad9f519f042836409f10b63fdcc7200d","message":"Thank you Stephen for such a nice post. it's really helpful.

The runtime behavior depends on the UI framework. Some of the more advanced/heavyweight frameworks will do the thread marshaling for you; while some of the lighter-weight frameworks will throw. And even the heavyweights do not always marshal; automatic marshaling is sometimes done for single properties (e.g., Disabled), but data-bound properties are another thing, and data-bound collections are yet another thing. Different frameworks have different automatic marshaling. Since I've written a lot of cross-platform code, I follow a strict rule in my code about never touching the UI from a background thread, even if some frameworks support it. That way my code always works.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"fb685f31-1d3c-3ac8-9936-c4301457db0f","date":"2018-01-20T14:49:37Z","timestamp":1516459777,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"},{"_id":"fb685f31-1d3c-3ac8-9936-c4301457db0f","authorName":"Bowen Zhu","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"b6420a5dd5fb035ae3c24e4081b3604d","message":"Thanks for your insight.

It's possible that CallContext.LogicalData will be lost under heavy load, together with async programming.  \r\nAre above statements all true?  \r\nAnd I remember you mentioned somewhere, we should create a context boundary in the codebase, for context-dependent/without ConfigureAwait(false), context-free/with ConfigureAwait(false), respectively, correct ?\r\n\r\nAnd another question, so in a WinForm UI program, consider below code  \r\npublic async void button1_eventhandler()  \r\n{  \r\n await InvokeFuncAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);  \r\n this.EditControl1.Disabled = false;  \r\n}\r\n\r\nthis.EditControl1.Disabled = false; should fail in some way, correct? because the resumed thread didn't load back the SynchronizationContext, but in my test, it actually works, any part I missed?","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"aaad59d2-a97a-3e69-a557-5dd693d32ad5","date":"2018-01-20T02:17:17Z","timestamp":1516414637,"authorUserId":"disqus:bowen_zhu"},{"_id":"d18a366e-61b6-32de-9121-a7dcd0441e88","authorName":"Bowen Zhu","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"b6420a5dd5fb035ae3c24e4081b3604d","message":"Still the same [asp.net](http://asp.net) example, to pass the Singleton to different handler of the same request.  \r\nUsing callcontext can reliable pass data, even I use configAwait(false) directly before access to CallContext.LogicalData, correct?  \r\nIf that's true, what advantage does HttpContext.Current hold?

In fact, I recommend that you use ConfigureAwait(false) whenever possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do *not* recommend blocking on asynchronous code, and thinking you can just \"make the deadlock go away\" by abusing ConfigureAwait(false). This is due to two reasons:  \r\n1) All of your \"asynchronous\" code that is blocked on must be aware that it is blocked on, and ensure that it uses ConfigureAwait(false) everywhere. \"All\" means the full transitive closure of all methods. It's extremely easy to miss one, and then you've got a deadlock - or even a deadlock that only sometimes happens. This is a maintenance nightmare.  \r\n2) Third-party code may or may not use ConfigureAwait(false). Or it may work in one version and then stop working in the next. Or it may work on one platform and not another (this actually happened with HttpClient).\r\n\r\nIt's far better to go async all the way. You end up with better design and more maintainable code.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"3bca749b-2343-3caf-b6bb-b90d414788fc","date":"2018-04-07T00:21:59Z","timestamp":1523060519,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"},{"_id":"8730635a-4c89-37e8-a5b8-665784384033","authorName":"Rick O'Shea","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"048fc88f7ba67bbdfb0dc310aacdedfd","message":"It's not friendly at all. You're compensating for a platform designed for sequential code, and doing so in a very unreliable and intrusive manner.

We do build Windows services cheaply and effectively using sequential code and scaling horizontally. That's cheaper and more reliable than trying to fix the broken platform with reams of extra manual code additions. Why aren't you instead ditching the framework? Addicted to .NET and C#?
