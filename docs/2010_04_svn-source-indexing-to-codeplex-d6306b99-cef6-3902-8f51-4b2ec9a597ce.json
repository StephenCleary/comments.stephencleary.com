On my first computer I also get an error \"Unable to resolve directory\", which happens apparantly in the file [svn.pm](http://svn.pm) on line 128 : \"  \r\n if ( ! open($hProcess, \"dir $SourceRoot 2>&1 |\") )   \r\n\", so it looks like it is impossible to open a pipe for getting the output of the dir command in the source directory.\r\n\r\nOn my second computer I don't get this, but the indexing only works if I type the svnindex command in the directory where the source is, which is a problem when the source is in different locations.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nI'm using the WDK8.1 on Win7-64 with svn1.9 and active perl, all in 32-bit.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nLuc","postId":"2010_04_svn-source-indexing-to-codeplex-d6306b99-cef6-3902-8f51-4b2ec9a597ce","replyTo":"","date":"2015-08-27T11:42:14Z","timestamp":1440675734}]
