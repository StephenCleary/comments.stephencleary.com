I selected **<u>*1920x1200/60*</u>** Hz as the maximum resolution.\r\n\r\n5. Since my primary display is a 28\" monitor set at 1920x1200, I selected the 1680x1050 resolution on this 24\" monitor to make the windows and the characters practically equal in size.\r\n\r\nIt worked! Can you believe it took me ten years to figure this out? I've been using the 1600 settings this entire time.","postId":"2008_07_soyo-widescreen-monitor-inf-available-6263ab40-ff2c-3cf7-ba98-2642a46a80bf","replyTo":"a8ab456d-816d-33e9-a2e5-e6acd99067a7","date":"2017-11-10T14:13:27Z","timestamp":1510323207,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_4OuFK2a8Pd"},{"_id":"a8ab456d-816d-33e9-a2e5-e6acd99067a7","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"ad2250182ff26a84dda974e50cd94382","message":"Sorry, it's been too long since I've worked with this, and I no longer have one of these monitors.","postId":"2008_07_soyo-widescreen-monitor-inf-available-6263ab40-ff2c-3cf7-ba98-2642a46a80bf","replyTo":"ae6b0ae5-8b59-3253-89d0-7f323f41b5b2","date":"2017-11-10T13:23:37Z","timestamp":1510320217,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"},{"_id":"ae6b0ae5-8b59-3253-89d0-7f323f41b5b2","authorName":"TempoNick","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"80c3188fbab666b2bcf2e1dba089c9be","message":"Stephen, do I need to do anything to get this to work with Windows 10, 32-bit?
