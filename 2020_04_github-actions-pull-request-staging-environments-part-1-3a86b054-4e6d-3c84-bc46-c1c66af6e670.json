Environments are started on cheap AWS lightsail instances in your own account, with support for SSH access, pretty URLs and Let's Encrypt HTTPS.\r\n\r\nI think you might be interested, especially since the whole code is open source ;)","date":"2020-05-11T10:18:31.419Z"},{"_id":"85bc8b20-d1ea-11ea-ad58-79193f5c10fc","postId":"2020_04_github-actions-pull-request-staging-environments-part-1-3a86b054-4e6d-3c84-bc46-c1c66af6e670","postUri":"https://blog.stephencleary.com/2020/04/github-actions-pull-request-staging-environments-part-1.html","replyTo":"","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"c0eacc2216ee78427fa0774c5ae419bf","authorName":"Mathias Lorenzen","authorUri":"https://dogger.io","message":"This was a great read.\r\n\r\nI made a GitHub app that automatically takes your Docker Compose file and makes a test environment from it, for every pull request you open. \r\n\r\nIt takes 47 seconds to set up, is fully managed, and has a free plan available. \r\n\r\nIt's used by the Portainer project (15k stars on GitHub). \r\n\r\nCheck it out: https://dogger.io","date":"2020-07-29T22:26:18.657Z"}]
