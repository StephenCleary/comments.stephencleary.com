It's probably a similar scenario to your \"true story\", where there's one server, just one client, and just one long-running connection. It's exceedingly simple: every 20 minutes or so the client sends a small message, server receives it and sends back a simple response. So far, I've got my server using the Begin*/End* approach to receiving and sending. So, according to the advice I read in another one of your articles, there is always an asynchronous receive in effect: as soon as the read-processing is done, a BeginSend() is queued and we go back to BeginReceive. Elsewhere, I've got a 3 second timer that performs a non-blocking, synchronous, zero-length Send() test (as per MSDN). The head-scratching thing is, this test always succeeds--even when the network cable on the remote side is unplugged. I thought it was clear from this article that doing a send while there was a physical break in connection would quickly uncover the connection issue, and allow the server to close its socket, thereby preventing the half-open connection problem you described. What am I missing?  \r\n\r\nThanks for any help.","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"","date":"2014-05-02T17:17:54Z","timestamp":1399051074},{"_id":"cecd14ee-6c99-3626-ab69-6e1d94647936","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"3db7b6e14d9da42751e4bab03bc4d034","authorUri":"https://stephencleary.com/","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"I'll post comments on the SO question: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23429543/why-doesnt-a-zero-length-send-fail-on-a-bad-tcp-socket-connection](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23429543/why-doesnt-a-zero-length-send-fail-on-a-bad-tcp-socket-connection)  \r\n\r\nHowever, I do not recommend zero-byte sends, MSDN docs notwithstanding. (As an aside, the MSDN examples for sockets are horrifyingly bad; at some point, I do plan to do a blog series just on fixing them). Zero-byte sends have to be special-cased through the network stack (which Microsoft does but other platforms do not), and any intermediate router is permitted to always drop those packets. So I consider this solution unreliable in the general case (i.e., the Internet).","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"","date":"2014-05-02T17:54:59Z","timestamp":1399053299},{"_id":"f08a4c25-1441-311a-93f0-b1f27a3d8274","authorName":"Bruce Stephenson","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"","authorUri":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/01321631245118583318","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"Hi Stephen,   \r\nThat was me who posted on SO, so I'll also pick it up over there.

This program is just a simulation of a very basic server application. It listens on a port, and wait for incoming messages. The listening Socket was defined to be a TCP Stream Socket. that's all that this program is doing.\r\n\r\nI had been deploying this exact same program on 2 different machines, both running on windows 7 professional 64bit. This machine will act as a host. and they are stationed in the same network area.\r\n\r\nthen, using the program \"nmap\", I used another machine on the same network, to act as a client. using the \"-sS\" parameter on \"nmap\", I do a Syn Scan, to the IP and Port of the listening simpleServer on both machine (one attempt at a time).\r\n\r\n(note that the 2 hosts already had \"wireshark\" started, and is monitoring on tcp packets from the client's IP and to the listening port.)\r\n\r\nIn the \"wireshark\" entry, on both machine, I saw the expected tcp packet for Syn Scan:\r\n\r\nclient ----(SYN)----> host\r\n\r\nclient <--(SYN/ACK)-- host\r\n\r\nclient ----(RST)----> host\r\n\r\nthe above packet exchange suggests that the connection was not established.\r\n\r\nBut on the \"simpleServer.exe\", only one of it had \"new incoming connection\" printed in the logs, while the other instance was not alerted of any new incoming connection, hence no logs at all.\r\n\r\nCode Snippets\r\n\r\niRetVal = WSAEventSelect (m_Socket, m_hSocketEvent, FD_ACCEPT);  \r\nif (SOCKET_ERROR == iRetVal)  \r\n{  \r\n if (WSAGetLastError()==WSAENOTSOCK)  \r\n {  \r\n return E_SOCKET_INVALID;  \r\n }\r\n\r\n printf (\"Error while WSAEventSelect().

The c++ program has a loop that sends a read request every other second to the c# program and then the c# program sends its response back. This part of the implementation works correctly. But I found a weird behavior when I added a different function (which is triggered by the user) that will make the read loop be idle for three seconds. The problem can only be seen if the function is triggered between send() and recv() calls. If this is the case I received a return -1 from the recv(). I have to mention that the c# program sends the response in less than 1 second so the method that is calling the send() and recv() commands goes idle at the time the data is transferred. I thought that if the process is not terminated, the data will wait in a buffer for a recv() commands. I wanted to know if this could be a case of half-open connections or I just have a bad implementation. I know it is really hard to say without taking a look to the code, but I would appreciate some general idea/comments about this issue.","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"","date":"2015-07-28T17:04:46Z","timestamp":1438103086},{"_id":"df20a4d9-a7d6-32a7-8ad1-c6a1ec56bab4","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"3db7b6e14d9da42751e4bab03bc4d034","authorUri":"https://stephencleary.com/","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"That doesn't sound like normal behavior; I think you may have a bug.\r\n\r\nTCP/IP should work just fine (up to a point) if you just let the incoming data sit in the buffer for a bit.

Quick question. I am a middleware guy, using IBM DataPower. Our client has a cloud application that submits SOAP requests to DataPower where we then send it off to a backend application. I am not allowed to ask for any changes to the client application, so we cannot add keep-alives or any other solution requiring a change on their end. When the client application goes away without sending us a RST packet, DataPower never knows the client has gone away until it tries to send the response back. DataPower, after failing to get an ACK packet, retries to send the response 8 times before giving up. At that point, DataPower does not pass that failure up to the application (XSL) layer so we cannot process that error (by, for example, un-doing the financial transaction at the backend). I'm told that capturing this specific failure is easy in Java and other tools, but I wrote Java HTTP and Socket servers which do not throw an exception for this case. Without altering the client for solutions you noted in this article (i.e., keep alives), can you tell if it is possible for this exception to be caught at the application layer (as opposed to the underlying OS IP layer which might not pop that error up)... and if so, what is the best way for me to show that via a proof of concept?","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"","date":"2017-05-06T00:35:20Z","timestamp":1494030920},{"_id":"20d1b6bb-8276-3ca0-9eff-693b6b72d209","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"3db7b6e14d9da42751e4bab03bc4d034","authorUri":"https://stephencleary.com/","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"I am not aware of any such tools, sorry.","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"33f456d8-1481-3fbb-aec1-63b57320315e","date":"2017-05-08T13:17:57Z","timestamp":1494249477},{"_id":"1971a909-0652-3f18-82bf-d4ea971e752d","authorName":"Doug Barker","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"4fa11b23a0d1151b1c71834532ee0ee7","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_AKfQIXg8jN","authorFallbackAvatar":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/disqus_AKfQIXg8jN.jpg","message":"Great post very well written   ","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"","date":"2017-06-08T12:46:20Z","timestamp":1496925980},{"_id":"389e700c-f37e-3ba5-ba59-c3a1274bb5cd","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"3db7b6e14d9da42751e4bab03bc4d034","authorUri":"https://stephencleary.com/","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"A successful ping only indicates that the ping is successful.

But, i am not still not able to understand the argument of having only one socket in our select sets. Select is used to check whether there is any activity on any of the sockets for a certain timeout period.Then after accepting the connection from master socket, we normally use FD_ISSET on each file descriptor for any activity before we call recv or send on that fd. So if there is no activity then FD_ISSET api will not succeed for that particular file descriptor and we can disconnect. And also this approach does not involve multithreading. Multiple clients are handled in a while loop using select.

Each time you call select, socket A gets some data available before the timeout, but socket B doesn't.\r\n\r\nIf your logic is \"if any socket reads data, then don't close any sockets\", then socket B (the one in a half-open state) will never be closed.\r\n\r\nIf your logic is \"close any socket that doesn't read data on every select call\", then socket B will be closed. However, your code will also end up closing all other sockets any time any socket reads data.\r\n\r\nThe only way to avoid this problem is to have a completely separate timer for each socket. This can be done by only using select with a single socket (which largely defeats the point of select). Or you could use explicit timers for sockets, checking each socket's timeout by hand each time select returns. But there's no way to get the select timeout itself working as a keep-alive (except for the trivial case of one socket in the select call).","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"fe5d9016-2256-3450-8482-9f1bcf12c983","date":"2018-02-01T03:02:05Z","timestamp":1517454125},{"_id":"c226a9d7-de97-3224-ab0a-782f5bc1929d","authorName":"Jay Ghiya","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"b639a04e96a94092bb729714f996804b","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"disqus:jayghiya","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"Thnks stephen for such detailed explanation. have added a explicit timer for each socket using setsockoption.","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"31d3c65d-40c9-3158-984a-61dcab19a741","date":"2018-02-02T09:50:13Z","timestamp":1517565013},{"_id":"c01c8212-b9f4-35a4-9bcc-823f3f574181","authorName":"Jay Ghiya","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"b639a04e96a94092bb729714f996804b","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"disqus:jayghiya","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"Hi Stephen,   \r\nIf i have to implement keep-alive mechanism for a process that handles 16-20 tcp clients and a multi client server which handles 5-10 connections.
