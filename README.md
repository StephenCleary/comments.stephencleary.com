# Comments for stephencleary.com

Comments on [stephencleary.com](https://stephencleary.com) work by posting to [Staticman](https://staticman.net/). Staticman converts the post data into a JSON document and commits it to this repository, under the `raw` folder. Commits trigger an [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/StephenCleary/comments-stephencleary-com) build, which runs a Node script that collects the `raw` files and writes the results to the `dist` folder. AppVeyor then commits those changes back to this repository in the `gh-pages` branch and emails Stephen Cleary.

The `gh-pages` branch is served by GitHub Pages through [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Those files are read dynamically from stephencleary.com and used to display the existing comments.
