# Comments for stephencleary.com

Comments on [stephencleary.com](https://stephencleary.com) work by posting to [Staticman](https://staticman.net/). Staticman converts the post data into a JSON document and commits it to this repository, under the `raw` folder. Commits trigger an [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) build, which runs a Node script that collects the `raw` files and writes the results to the `docs` folder. AppVeyor then commits those changes back to this repository and emails Stephen Cleary.

The `docs` folder is served by GitHub Pages through [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Those files are read dynamically from stephencleary.com and used to display the existing comments.
