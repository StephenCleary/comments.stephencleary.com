This is because simple substring matching is insufficient. Consider not only CDATA, but also comments and child nodes with the same name.  \r\n\r\nYou actually have to end up writing a partial XML parser, which is made more complex by having to accept partial input (i.e., a SAX-style parser rather than a DOM-style parser). It's a lot easier to just wrap it with message framing.","postId":"2009_07_xml-over-tcpip-ef705309-219f-33bf-b68b-bc672c257e4c","replyTo":"","date":"2011-01-03T09:11:16Z","timestamp":1294045876},{"_id":"08b9dc9d-40cb-3e7d-9ac5-85b7daf931f8","authorName":"Anonymous","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"i am a noob my friend i am doing whiteboard i want to pass the object over network help me","postId":"2009_07_xml-over-tcpip-ef705309-219f-33bf-b68b-bc672c257e4c","replyTo":"","date":"2011-11-13T20:48:26Z","timestamp":1321217306},{"_id":"13a76e44-df2e-3dd5-acbd-68073e61e074","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"3db7b6e14d9da42751e4bab03bc4d034","authorUri":"https://stephencleary.com/","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"One socket will only send one group of bytes at a time; there is no way they can \"interfere\". \"Mutilated\" messages are usually the result of assuming a single Send can be received by a single Receive.  \r\n\r\nYou are probably missing message framing.

In addition, some request types result in that notification messages are sent from server to client. These notifications occur at inpredictable times. Is it possible that a notification message interferes with a request message if they are sent at exactly the same timestamp (using the same socket)? Could this be the reason that I sometimes observe that mutilated messages are received by the client?
