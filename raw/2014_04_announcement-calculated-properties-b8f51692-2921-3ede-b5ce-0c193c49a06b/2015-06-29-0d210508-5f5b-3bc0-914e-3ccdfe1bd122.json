I will have to study your solution to better understand how it comes from Windows. I'm just saying that the manual implementation is not too bad because, even if the pieces of the \"getter\" and the \"notifier\" code are far from each other, at least it is clear where to find the corresponding OnPropertyChanged by looking at the component Properties in the getter... and I'm saying that the lack of a more standard solution could be seen as a general weekness of MVVM (a dependency property? maybe to complicated). Anyway I will try your approach. Thanks for sharing it! :-)","postId":"2014_04_announcement-calculated-properties-b8f51692-2921-3ede-b5ce-0c193c49a06b","replyTo":"ac5e2d84-c61d-3171-87e6-8f359f64acbd","date":"2015-06-29T19:37:08Z","timestamp":1435606628}
