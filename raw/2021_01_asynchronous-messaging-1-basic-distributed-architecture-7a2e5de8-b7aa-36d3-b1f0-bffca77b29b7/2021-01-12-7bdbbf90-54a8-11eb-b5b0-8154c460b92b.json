It is very hard to imagine microservice-based architecture without queues. Having a chain of synchronous calls (HTTP) to multiple services is not resilient and makes it much harder to process high load(one service in the chain can slow down the entire platform) also deployment wise - it is soooo much easier to deploy service when it reads from the queue (Cancellation tokens + nacking the messages). Yes, it isn't a silver bullet, if you need a response - you need to use HTTP (or webhook/callback as an option if the processing of the request takes too long). Great article, looking forward to the next chapter!","date":"2021-01-12T07:33:37.817Z"}
