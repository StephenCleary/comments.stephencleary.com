Steven. I'm new to ASP.NET , Sharepoint. C # has been in development for 5 years. Currently, I have a page with web user control (C #) pasted on a site page created by sharepoint designer, and when I click the button, the synchronization process works and it takes 3 hours. The maximum timeout of ALB of cloud service can be set only up to 1 hour, and the process of throwing a ping to ALB once every 30 minutes by asynchronous processing when the button is clicked has been added to c # in the button click event. When I actually run it, I get an error when sharepoint needs to set the async attribute, and I added the async attribute to the site page, but then I get another error. When I contacted Microsoft support, I was told that the sharepoint site page doesn't support the async attribute and I can do it by creating an application page, but I'm new to sharepoint and I'm also new to ASP.NET . I don't know how to write it on the application page. Can you tell me how to write it?\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I don't have any experience with SharePoint. But in general, `async` isn't going to help you if you have a 3 hour web request. You'll need to queue up the work into some kind of durable queue and then process it later. I'm not sure of the best way to do this with SharePoint/ALB, sorry.","date":"2022-07-09T19:17:43.707Z"}
