Software used in life-and-death situations sometimes requires a different approach. *Sometimes*; e.g., the requirements could include a Mutual Assured Destruction policy.\r\n\r\nConsider the client's perspective. They send a request and then get a non-error response. It is reasonable for the client to conclude that the operation will be attempted. Perhaps delayed a second or two if it happens to be in the middle of a rolling upgrade or something, but in the >99% case, the client has a reasonable expectation that the operation will be attempted based on a non-error response. Without durable queues, the client cannot make that assumption; it is entirely possible that the client makes a request, receives a non-error response, and then the requested operation is never even attempted. It just disappears.","date":"2021-01-15T15:14:18.782Z"}
