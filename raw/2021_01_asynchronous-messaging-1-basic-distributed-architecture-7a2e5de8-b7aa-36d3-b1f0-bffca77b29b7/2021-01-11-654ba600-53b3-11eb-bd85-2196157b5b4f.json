IMHO Actor based programming in general...and Akka.NET in particular...solve a number of thorny issues in async distributed systems. The renowned Dr James McCaffrey acknowledged/discussed this here: https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2017/12/04/the-akka-net-framework/\r\n\r\nAlso IMHO, the Achilles heal of Akka.NET has been a lack of built-in at-least-once-delivery for out-of-process messages. It wasn't exactly easy to implement but I eventually figured out how to integrate Service Bus Queues with Akka.NET actors as solid mechanism for guaranteed at-least-once-delivery of out-of-process messages. \r\n\r\nIf interested, I'd be most honored to privately collaborate with you and help you expand your understanding of where Actor based programming could really enhance what you're trying to accomplish with this series of posts. I suspect you've got access to my email address from this forum; if not please let me how you'd like to communicate.","date":"2021-01-11T02:19:13.161Z"}
