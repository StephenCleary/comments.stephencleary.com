A custom SyncCtx is the only reasonable approach, but it can cause some subtle problems. E.g., there are several (old-school, not Core) ASP.NET APIs that assume SynchronizationContext.Current is AspNetSynchronizationContext, and if it isn't, they silently fail. Which is not so cool. There isn't really anything you can do about that, though.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see this paired with a Roslyn-based compile-time analyzer for deadlock detection.","postId":"2016_12_eliding-async-await-98a72933-845d-3c59-9bd5-b4160554a9f7","replyTo":"69efb794-eb63-31fe-ae5c-de009417c472","date":"2017-01-20T15:16:04Z","timestamp":1484925364}
