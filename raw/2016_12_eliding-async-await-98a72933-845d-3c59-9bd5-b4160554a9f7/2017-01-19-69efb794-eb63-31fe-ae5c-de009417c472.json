Then you are probably aware of deadlocks when mixing async and synchronous code. I have created a library to help detect these issues. When I look at your passion about async/await, I would be very interested in your opinion about it. Of course, it's open-source and you can find it at [https://github.com/ramondeklein/deadlockdetection](https://github.com/ramondeklein/deadlockdetection).
