There's plenty of code out there that follows either approach (or both!). And for boneheaded exceptions, it doesn't really matter. For all other exceptions, the only reasonable approach is to place them on the returned task.\r\n\r\nWhether to eagerly throw precondition exceptions depends on your perspective, particularly this:\r\n\r\n> the work represented by the task never gets underway, so I don't really expect the method to return me a task.\r\n\r\nThe work *is* the method itself - that's what the task represents. So, if preconditions are run \"before\" the method (logically, not literally), then yes, it makes sense to want the exception thrown directly. But if preconditions are run at the beginning of the method, then it makes sense to fault the task. Jon Skeet is in the throw-directly camp, but I think it doesn't really matter - either way, precondition violations are boneheaded exceptions and thus shouldn't be caught anyway.","postId":"2016_12_eliding-async-await-98a72933-845d-3c59-9bd5-b4160554a9f7","replyTo":"854b548c-7547-30a3-902a-7a994c520380","date":"2016-12-02T11:11:15Z","timestamp":1480677075,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
