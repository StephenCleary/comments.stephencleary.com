My view has always been that the task represents some work to be done.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's my background in kernel mode device drivers (where everything is async) but the most straightforward view of any async operation to me is some work you've asked to be performed that will take a while to complete. When IO is involved, that very often means that the bulk of the work won't be done by the CPU - it'll be handled by some peripheral. At this point, saying that the task is the *method* seems way off base.","postId":"2016_12_eliding-async-await-98a72933-845d-3c59-9bd5-b4160554a9f7","replyTo":"3f2eaa86-8cf0-3b0a-8be4-906527397a34","date":"2016-12-16T15:11:01Z","timestamp":1481901061}
