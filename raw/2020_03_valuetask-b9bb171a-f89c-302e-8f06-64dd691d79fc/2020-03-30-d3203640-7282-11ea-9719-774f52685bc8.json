Do you have an idea why ValueTask was designed with these pitfalls? The async programming stack is already riddled with gotchas (sporadic deadlocks when blocking, and async void exceptions crashing the app come to mind) and one would have thought ValueTask could have been a chance to design an easier and safer way to do async programming in dotnet. Naively, it seems to me that some of these would have been easy to avoid - for instance by not providing a Result property if it is never to be used anyway. There must be good reasons why it was designed this way, no?","date":"2020-03-30T12:34:40.389Z"}
