I do think a different pattern would have helped here, because the way it is now is exactly like another pattern with *completely different semantics*. So it's not easy or natural to assume the same code will behave completely differently when you change a variable from `Task<T>` to `ValueTask<T>`.","date":"2020-04-10T13:28:51.637Z"}
