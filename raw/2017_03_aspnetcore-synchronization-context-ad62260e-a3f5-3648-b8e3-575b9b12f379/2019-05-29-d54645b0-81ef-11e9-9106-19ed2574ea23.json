Is there any way to check from code that there is no context? I’m asking because I have tested value of SynchronizationContext.Current on couple environments – on WPF it is set, on .NET Core console it is null but on Full framework console it is also null. Other thing is that when I run some awaited method with ConfigureAwait(true) when context is null I’m returning to the same thread so it is working like it should even with empty context. Maybe I’m suppose to check different thing so question is – can I execute some code to check if I have context and if I really don’t have context like on ASP.NET can I return somehow to original thread?","date":"2019-05-29T08:57:49.634Z"}
