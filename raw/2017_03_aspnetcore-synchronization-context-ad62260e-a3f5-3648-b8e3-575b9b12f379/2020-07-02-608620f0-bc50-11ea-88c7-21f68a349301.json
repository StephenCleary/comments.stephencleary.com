However I have a below situation - \r\n\r\nI have a .Net standard (2.x) library and that is consumed by ASP .Net Core (3.x)  project. In this scenario do we need to use ConfigureAwait(false) in my .Net standard library or not? Atleat in my opinion we should still use ConfigureAwait(false) as the .Net standard library can also be consumed by Old ASP .Net projects. What's your opinion? Thanks.","date":"2020-07-02T10:39:59.367Z"}
