This branch of .NET used to be called .NET Core from version 1 up until version 3. It skipped version 4, and is now (as of version 5 and newer) just called \u0022.NET\u0022. In other words, the version after \u0022.NET Core 3.1\u0022 was \u0022.NET 5.0\u0022.\n\nASP.NET has not (yet) dropped the \u0022Core\u0022 part of its name, so it\u0027s properly \u0022ASP.NET Core\u0022. Thus, it\u0027s correct to say that \u0022ASP.NET Core 8.0\u0022 runs on \u0022.NET 8.0\u0022.\n\nMeanwhile, there is another very old usage of \u0022NetCore\u0022 that I believe you\u0027re remembering. The old \u0060netcore45\u0060 / \u0060netcore451\u0060 referred to Windows Store apps for Windows 8.0 / 8.1, respectively. And there was briefly a \u0060netcore50\u0060 which was for Universal Windows Platform apps. All of these are deprecated at this point and most people aren\u0027t even aware the term \u0022NetCore\u0022 was even used for them. This blog post has nothing to do with those old desktop technologies; it\u0027s about the modern ASP.NET Core.","date":"2024-02-16T03:33:25.1767534Z"}
