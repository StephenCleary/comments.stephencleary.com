If not, then what am I seeing?\r\n\r\nThere's a difference between \".NET Core\" and \"ASP.NET Core\". The point of this blog post is that there is no `SynchronizationContext` in *ASP.NET Core apps*. There are `SynchronizationContext`s in other kinds of .NET Core apps, including UI apps.\r\n\r\n> A second, somewhat unrelated question. How many threads are there in the threadpool of a DotNet Core application? Is there any way to find out?\r\n\r\nThere are [some methods on the `ThreadPool` type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.threadpool.getmaxthreads) that will tell you that, but generally you don't want your code basing any logic on how busy the thread pool is. Usually you'd use a profiling tool to determine any thread pool problems and then possibly have a one-time adjustment at startup.","date":"2020-08-15T20:00:10.772Z"}
