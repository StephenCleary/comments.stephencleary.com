If they are being handled synchronously, and SendAsync is behaving synchronously, then just let that stand. That's usually better than introducing parallelism in an ASP.NET environment.\r\n\r\nBut if that's not acceptable, then I'd use TPL Dataflow here, rather than AsyncBarrier. I'm also not clear on how QBWI comes into play, unless the main operation is fire-and-forget, which sounds dangerous.","postId":"2013_10_taskrun-etiquette-and-proper-usage-fe7a94d6-0c34-3e54-ab2d-97969a27b041","replyTo":"1a2b43f7-c42d-37da-9a5e-3e4da2af94a6","date":"2017-11-29T13:53:41Z","timestamp":1511963621}
