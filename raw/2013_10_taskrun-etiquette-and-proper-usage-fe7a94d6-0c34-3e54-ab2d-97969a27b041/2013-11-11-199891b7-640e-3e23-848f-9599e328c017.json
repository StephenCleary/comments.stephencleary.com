Should I use Task.Run for the CPU-bound parts? The answer is still no.  \r\n\r\nHow would you recommend to improve next sample:  \r\n\r\nasync public Task RequestServerAsync()  \r\n {  \r\n var resultString = await new NetworkManager().GetAsync(Constants.SERVER_REQUEST); // Just a wrapper for await httpWebRequest.GetResponseAsync() and await postStreamReader.ReadToEndAsync()  \r\n\r\n var answer = await ParseCategoriesFromString(resultString); // await TaskEx.Run(() => JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(resultString));  \r\n\r\n return answer;  \r\n }","postId":"2013_10_taskrun-etiquette-and-proper-usage-fe7a94d6-0c34-3e54-ab2d-97969a27b041","replyTo":"","date":"2013-11-11T22:11:57Z","timestamp":1384207917}
