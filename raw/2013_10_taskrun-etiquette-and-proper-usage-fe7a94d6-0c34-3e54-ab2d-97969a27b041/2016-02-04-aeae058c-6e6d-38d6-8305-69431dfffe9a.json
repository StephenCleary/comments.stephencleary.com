My book covers concurrency in general, including parallelism (i.e., Parallel.For / Parallel LINQ), asynchrony (async/await), dataflow (TPL Dataflow), and reactive programming (Rx). So there's a lot of topics that aren't covered by my blog. But on the other hand, I go into a lot more detail re asynchrony on my blog that I don't have in my book.","postId":"2013_10_taskrun-etiquette-and-proper-usage-fe7a94d6-0c34-3e54-ab2d-97969a27b041","replyTo":"c5b56eb1-c940-3d14-8171-3fae05df184c","date":"2016-02-04T18:43:17Z","timestamp":1454611397}
