In an environment where the latency of a single request is more important  (and you know you will only have one or a small number of concurrent clients) then there's no problem using Task.Run.\r\n\r\nJust be aware of the tradeoffs you're making.  And don't forget to measure, since it does have overhead and using it blindly can increase latency.","date":"2020-01-06T20:12:39.480Z"}
