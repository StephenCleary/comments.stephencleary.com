Basically the client consumer awaits a call into a do-a-thing-async method, some of the arguments passed to the method control how long the user wants to wait before abandoning, like a certain client understood condition, a timeout, etc. my client implementation uses [task.run](http://task.run \"task.run\") with an async delegate, the reason for this is that Internally I'm doing awaiting on a semaphoreslim while waiting for an appropriate series of signalr events to get pushed from the server.\r\n\r\nI'm following all the TAP design rules, configuring my awaiters properly and doing all the other things that I've read from you an others that would be considered best practices, except not using [task.run](http://task.run \"task.run\") in the implementation. Is this a bad idea?","postId":"2013_10_taskrun-etiquette-and-proper-usage-fe7a94d6-0c34-3e54-ab2d-97969a27b041","replyTo":"","date":"2016-10-27T14:55:04Z","timestamp":1477580104,"authorUserId":"disqus:chris_cappelletti"}
