I've used it many times, but now I have an issue related to it. In one scenario my service should return a list of some objects which I use later but on load I need to show the sum of some property of objects in the list. The only approach I come with is the subscribing to PropertyChanged event of NotifyTaskCompletion and raise PropertyChaned event of the property which should calculate the sum when I am receiving event of IsSuccessfullyCompleted. IMO it is an ugly solution. Can you suggest any other one or have you any thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","postId":"2014_04_announcement-msdn-async-mvvm-articles-b2165e1d-7e99-386d-b481-ed64583f3ab7","replyTo":"","date":"2016-01-20T17:52:36Z","timestamp":1453312356,"authorUserId":"disqus:hamlethakobyan"}
