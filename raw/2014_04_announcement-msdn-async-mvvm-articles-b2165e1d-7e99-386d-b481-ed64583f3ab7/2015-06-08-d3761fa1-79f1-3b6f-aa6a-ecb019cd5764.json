NotifyTaskCompletion fits the first case and AsyncCommand the second. At the moment I use the latter and just call the Execute method of the command in the constructor. Probably not the best but it seems to work. I am using the AsyncEx version of NotifyTaskCompletion and had to make minor modifications to your AsyncCommand in the articles. Occasionally it appears that Execution.TaskCompleted is null","postId":"2014_04_announcement-msdn-async-mvvm-articles-b2165e1d-7e99-386d-b481-ed64583f3ab7","replyTo":"6659bf5f-a48a-3efa-bd57-d77effcee974","date":"2015-06-08T20:26:44Z","timestamp":1433795204,"authorUserId":"disqus:alan_rutter"}
