That is how i understand it, what bugs me though is that the ViewModel is in invalid state while it\u0027s loading data, which i think it\u0027s bad practice as all object once created should have all properties in valid state right ? but in this case a property might return null and after some time once we access it again it might return a value. But to be honest I don\u0027t think there is any solution for this problem since properties can\u0027t be async, and can\u0027t return Task\u003CT\u003E cause binding will not work so, I think it\u0027s ok to treat ViewModel as special classes that can have \u0022fire and forget\u0022 stuff in ctor and being in undefined state while data is loading as long as it clear to the consumer.","date":"2023-11-12T22:25:51.2721683Z"}
