TPL Dataflow is designed to always flow data through as quickly as possible. (The \"throttling\" in TPL Dataflow is more of a \"don't process more than these *at the same time*\", not \"over a period of time\").\r\n\r\nFor time-related operations, I recommend using System.Reactive. Rx has a number of built-in throttling systems that work with time durations.\r\n\r\nAnd as a bonus, TPL Datafow and System.Reactive plug in well to each other!","postId":"2012_11_async-producerconsumer-queue-using-7d55b643-a325-3ba0-9ffa-7ec6b0363eaf","replyTo":"8e83b8b9-1893-3b43-ba8e-1a8c05947a86","date":"2016-10-04T17:11:08Z","timestamp":1475601068}
