I posted another couple of questions but it disappeared. I think I resolved one of them (11) when I re-select the same items and submit again - nothing happens. This appears to be because the queue was completed and so I tested that removing the call to Complete and the queue.Completion parameter in the WaitAll fixes this without any apparent side effects so far, although I'm not sure if it is a good idea. (12) The items are processed asynchronously (non-blocking w.r.t the Main thread), which is as we expect, but they don't always appear to process concurrently; more often than not they appear to be processed sequentially w.r.t one another... is there a way to force them to process concurrently as well?","postId":"2012_11_async-producerconsumer-queue-using-7d55b643-a325-3ba0-9ffa-7ec6b0363eaf","replyTo":"24cf38aa-a9c6-383b-96f7-94de4197da9b","date":"2016-08-24T15:56:39Z","timestamp":1472054199,"authorUserId":"disqus:buggysquashy"}
