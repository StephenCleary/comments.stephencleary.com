Synchronous consumers can of course use Receive, but asynchronous consumers can't use TryReceive because it doesn't asynchronously wait. That said, asynchronous consumers are probably a rarity.  \r\n\r\nAnd I agree that the multiple consumers example is not realistic; in most situations with multiple consumers, they would all be doing the same thing so you could just parallelize them as you suggested.","postId":"2012_11_async-producerconsumer-queue-using-7d55b643-a325-3ba0-9ffa-7ec6b0363eaf","replyTo":"","date":"2012-12-03T00:09:05Z","timestamp":1354493345,"authorUserId":""}
