You'd need to create a new block if you want to start over. Or, you could just not complete the block as you mentioned - that would work fine. Many apps set up a dataflow mesh and just leave it operational.\r\n\r\nIf you only have one consumer, then (of course) it can only process one message at a time. You can attach multiple consumers to a producer/consumer queue, or you can change the queue to a mesh and use ActionBlock instead of BufferBlock. You can then set the MaxDegreeOfParallelism option on the ActionBlock to enable parallel consumption.","postId":"2012_11_async-producerconsumer-queue-using-7d55b643-a325-3ba0-9ffa-7ec6b0363eaf","replyTo":"6f51f1e4-4ed7-3083-af13-f118de7f6187","date":"2017-10-04T15:59:51Z","timestamp":1507132791}
