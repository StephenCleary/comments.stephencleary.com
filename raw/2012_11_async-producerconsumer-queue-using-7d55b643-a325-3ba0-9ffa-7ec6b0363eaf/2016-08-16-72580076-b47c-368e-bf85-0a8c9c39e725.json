(2) How can I delete some items from the queue (in my application specifically, remove or kill some cases in my queue that are just \"waiting\" to run). (3) Also in your throttling example, can I make the queue a private member of the class, and if I retained your consume and produce functions, then can I have a separate functions which is called by the user interface - one which mimics the one in your unit test to actually run the cases, and another one to remove or kill waiting cases, am I right in understanding this? (4) Also, how can I manage the waiting cases, since I would need to know the cases which are in the queue but not running at any given moment, so that I can kill them if instructed by the user interface (or if user specifies so, then to kill them regardless if they are running or waiting).","postId":"2012_11_async-producerconsumer-queue-using-7d55b643-a325-3ba0-9ffa-7ec6b0363eaf","replyTo":"","date":"2016-08-16T14:39:22Z","timestamp":1471358362}
