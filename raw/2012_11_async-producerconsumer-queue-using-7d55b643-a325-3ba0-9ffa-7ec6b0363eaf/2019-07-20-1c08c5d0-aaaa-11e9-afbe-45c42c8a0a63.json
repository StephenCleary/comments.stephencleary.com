I have a question and any help would be highly appreciated.  If I have multiple consumers can I write them like this?\r\n\r\n        async Task Consume(BufferBlock<int> buffer)\r\n        {\r\n            await Task.Run(() =>\r\n            {\r\n                int item;\r\n                while (buffer.TryReceive(out item))\r\n                {\r\n                    // Do some processing here\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n\r\nOnce again, thanks alot for your time.","date":"2019-07-20T04:52:00.629Z"}
