I have a query.\r\nProducer is multi-threaded, reading messages and sending to Consumer. Consumer reads received messages and sends email. After that I want to update the status to sent. This status I would like to use back in the producer to remove the message from queue. I am using ConcurrentDictionay, BufferBlock Please can you suggest how this can be done ? Thanks again","date":"2020-05-29T13:08:39.447Z"}
