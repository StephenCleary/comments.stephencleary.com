I have a scenario where the database response are received in segments(pieces) with a timed delay (certain milliseconds) for a particular request. The consumer has to wait certain milliseconds for next segment to arrive every time it receives a segment, but return that segment immediately to UI. In the mean time we keep receiving requests and every request has same cycle to go through. Traditional produce - consumer model seems to not handle the delayed response cycle well. Do you recommend a better solution?","postId":"2012_11_async-producerconsumer-queue-using-7d55b643-a325-3ba0-9ffa-7ec6b0363eaf","replyTo":"","date":"2016-03-09T22:34:56Z","timestamp":1457562896,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_lglbHNZnIf"}
