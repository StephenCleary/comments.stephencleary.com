I'm not quite sure if i know what you mean by a dataflow-based solution? So tpl dataflow is not really meant for advanced transformation/processing of the data? More like targeting simple data?\r\n\r\nThe idea behind that producer/consumer in a pipeline, was to split up logically different parts so they can run parallel, since reading of XML's f.e. can take a while, but also importing the data into the database.\r\n\r\nOrdered your book, should be here tomorrow - so i can get a better inside look into TPL dataflow.\r\n\r\nWaiting for the lock is probably a no go, since this can take hours even. I only need to retain order within those jobs that reference the same item, not all of them, which makes it slightly easier.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!","postId":"2012_11_async-producerconsumer-queue-using-7d55b643-a325-3ba0-9ffa-7ec6b0363eaf","replyTo":"4786a8b0-e1a6-31ea-8a81-7105e16f9659","date":"2016-12-19T13:21:14Z","timestamp":1482153674,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_hLG8Vpfw7A"}
