However interestingly after several days of working properly the pipeline has come to a hault. Upon checking I found out that sometimes the inputs to the batchblock come in after the ActionBlocks are done with their work. In this case the ActionBlocks do actually call Triggerbatch at the end of their work, however since at this point there is no input to the Batchblock at all, the call to TriggerBatch is fruitless. And after a while when inputs do flow in to the Batchblock, there is no one left to call TriggerBatch and restart the Pipeline. I was looking for something where I could just check if something is infact present in the inputbuffer of the Batchblock, however there is no such feature available, I could also not find a way to check if the TriggerBatch was fruitful.","postId":"2012_11_async-producerconsumer-queue-using-7d55b643-a325-3ba0-9ffa-7ec6b0363eaf","replyTo":"a5934daa-8613-3be2-9f8c-eaaabb2d24c5","date":"2015-09-22T10:07:14Z","timestamp":1442916434,"authorUserId":"disqus:xenonforlife"}
