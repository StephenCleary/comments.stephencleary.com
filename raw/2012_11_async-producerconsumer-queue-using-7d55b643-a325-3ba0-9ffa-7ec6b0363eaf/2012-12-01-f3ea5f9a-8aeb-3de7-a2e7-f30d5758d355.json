You don't need TryReceiveAsync(), TryReceive() is enough, because it does not block.  \r\n\r\nAnd I think your example with multiple consumers is not very realistic. If you want to have parallel consumer, you would use one block with MaxDegreeOfParallelism instead. (Unless each of the consumers represented some external resource. Which is an idea I'd like to explore more some day: using TDF for managing computations distributed over several computers, though I'm not sure how well would that work.)","postId":"2012_11_async-producerconsumer-queue-using-7d55b643-a325-3ba0-9ffa-7ec6b0363eaf","replyTo":"","date":"2012-12-01T21:21:48Z","timestamp":1354396908}
