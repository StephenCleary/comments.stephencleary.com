If you want to use more TPL Dataflow, then I'd recommend looking into ActionBlock instead of BufferBlock (which essentially moves your consumer(s) into the dataflow mesh). And no, with multiple consumers, you can't guarantee FIFO because multiple items are processed at once.","postId":"2012_11_async-producerconsumer-queue-using-7d55b643-a325-3ba0-9ffa-7ec6b0363eaf","replyTo":"9f99ae37-3b8e-360a-b7f2-b2d78b9774fe","date":"2017-07-10T13:53:10Z","timestamp":1499694790}
