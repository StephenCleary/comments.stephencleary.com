I think \u0022Clean Up and Disposal\u0022 is a topic which might warrant a separate entry in your series on CTS (judging by the number of question on StackOverflow) :)\n\nI also have a couple of questions on the topic:\n\n1. _\u0022You can either cancel or dispose, but you should ensure one or the other is done to avoid resource leaks.\u0022_ - It seems that Cancel does not do exactly the same things as Dispose. So in this case you mean that GC will later dispose what is necessary through Finalizers, OR do you mean that even without GC, calling Cancel by itself is enough to avoid memory leaks?\n\n2. _\u0022If the CancellationToken is saved and used later, then you don\u2019t want to dispose the CancellationTokenSource.\u0022_ - Could you clarify why not? I thought that if you Cancel and then Dispose - you would have just an orphaned cancelled token, but I assume some operations on such token will cause an exception? Can you clarify which operations exactly?\n\nThanks!","date":"2024-08-12T14:15:41.0445183Z"}
