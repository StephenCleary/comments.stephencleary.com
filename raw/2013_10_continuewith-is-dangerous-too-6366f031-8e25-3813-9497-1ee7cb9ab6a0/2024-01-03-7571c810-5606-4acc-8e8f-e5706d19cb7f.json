I wasn\u0027t totally aware that it does return and the caller can choose not to await, too. Still I\u0027d have to store the task somewhere which I wanted to avoid. And the caller might not know whether it\u0027s a good idea to await or not here.\n\nI could now rewrite the code to have a dedicated callback running when the handshake is complete, so I don\u0027t have to await the task that indicates it. (After all, the task is also completed from somewhere with the \u0060TaskCompletionSource\u0060.)","date":"2024-01-03T21:38:19.6231936Z"}
