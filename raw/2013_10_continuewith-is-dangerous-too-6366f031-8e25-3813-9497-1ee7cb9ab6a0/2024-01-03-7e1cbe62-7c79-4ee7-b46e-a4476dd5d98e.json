Your first paragraph correctly states that \u0060await\u0060 only runs the following code until the task completes, and you don\u0027t want this. But then later you say you have something to be executed whenever the task completes. _Which is exactly what \u0060await\u0060 gives you_. So I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s wrong with \u0060await\u0060 here; it seems to be exactly what you want.\n\nThe method containing the \u0060await\u0060 will return as soon as it \u0060await\u0060s some task that is not yet complete. It will return an incomplete task. If the _calling_ method doesn\u0027t want to \u0060await\u0060 that task right away, that\u0027s fine; it doesn\u0027t have to.\n\nIt sounds like you may be writing your own TCP/IP server. It\u0027s pretty common for those to have a list of connections; you can just store the task in the client connection object.","date":"2024-01-03T03:49:31.4894251Z"}
