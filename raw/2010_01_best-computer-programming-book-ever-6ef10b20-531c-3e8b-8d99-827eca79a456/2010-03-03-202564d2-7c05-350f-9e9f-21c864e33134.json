I am particularly surprised because you are clearly a very intelligent person, and yet single out a specific book like that, and blindly trust everything in it...  \r\n\r\nTry looking at what the Bible says and evaluating it with the same clarity of mind as you evaluate programming issues (IDisposable for example).  \r\n\r\n\"When you buy a male Hebrew slave, he shall serve for six years, but in the seventh he shall go out a free person, without debt.\" - this is grounded in the Bible (Exodus 21:2). Hope you are at least a little skeptical about this.","postId":"2010_01_best-computer-programming-book-ever-6ef10b20-531c-3e8b-8d99-827eca79a456","replyTo":"","date":"2010-03-03T02:54:00Z","timestamp":1267584840}
