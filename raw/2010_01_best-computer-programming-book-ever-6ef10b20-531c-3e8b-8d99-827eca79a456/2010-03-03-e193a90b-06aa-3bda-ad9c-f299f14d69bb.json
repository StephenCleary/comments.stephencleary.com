Still, there is no way to absolutely prove the entire Bible (if there were, then Christianity - a faith-based system - would cease to exist).  \r\n\r\nAt times, I have doubted the Bible. However, I have always found the Bible to be true, if understood in context.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the Bible does not condone slavery, but does have instructions for how to live in a society where slavery is accepted. In the particular passage you quoted, the instructions are not even dealing with \"slavery\" as we think of it today; the system was more what we would call \"indentured servitude\" (the person in question has sold himself into temporary service to pay off a debt).  \r\n\r\nTrue slavery in the Bible is only found when one nation conquors another and takes slaves (usually from the youth). Even then, it was common practice to practically adopt such slaves, even to the point of making them heirs! Very different than the mental image of \"slavery\" that exists in modern Western culture.","postId":"2010_01_best-computer-programming-book-ever-6ef10b20-531c-3e8b-8d99-827eca79a456","replyTo":"","date":"2010-03-03T16:54:37Z","timestamp":1267635277,"authorUserId":""}
