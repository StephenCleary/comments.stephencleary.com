It\u0027s not as unexpected as some other exception, but it\u0027s not as happy as finishing without being cancelled.\n\nIn other languages - specifically, those using Either types instead of exceptions - the natural expression of cancellation would be different. There are some Either types in C# that have been introduced by various functional-programming libraries, but none of them has seen wide adoption. And so the BCL used the exception pattern, and everything else (almost) has followed suit.\n\nUsing exceptions for flow control also does feel odd to me in this instance, so I know what you\u0027re feeling. But I think it\u0027s the solution that fits the best with the C# language as it was (this was .NET Framework 4.0, so long before any major FP-inspired changes like switch expressions).","date":"2024-08-15T00:26:25.7241722Z"}
