The key aspect of truly-asynchronous APIs is that there is no thread: [https://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/11/there-is-no-thread.html](https://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/11/there-is-no-thread.html)\r\n\r\nThink of it this way: EF's SaveChangesAsync builds your SQL and sends it out to the database server. It then has to wait for a response from the db server. What's the point in blocking a thread just to wait for a response on the network? So there's no thread spun up just to do that - that would be silly. Instead, it registers a handler: \"when the response comes in, call this method.\" You can think of async/await as being event-driven, because it is. (At least, when dealing with I/O operations).","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"af71f6cd-2902-3f9f-96da-38d126786be0","date":"2018-04-26T02:29:01Z","timestamp":1524709741}
