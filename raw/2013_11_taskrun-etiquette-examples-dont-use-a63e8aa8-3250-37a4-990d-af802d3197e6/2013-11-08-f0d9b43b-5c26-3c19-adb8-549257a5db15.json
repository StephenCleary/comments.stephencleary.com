Especially since it is so easy to be asynchronous with async/await, but is also oh so easy to shoot oneself in the foot by lacking of understanding of what really happens behind the curtains. You've perfectly illustrated it with an ASP.NET Task.Run() misusing example and I've had an \"Oh, wow, I'd never think about it!\" reaction while reading it.  \r\n\r\nThanks again.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"","date":"2013-11-08T16:58:20Z","timestamp":1383929900}
