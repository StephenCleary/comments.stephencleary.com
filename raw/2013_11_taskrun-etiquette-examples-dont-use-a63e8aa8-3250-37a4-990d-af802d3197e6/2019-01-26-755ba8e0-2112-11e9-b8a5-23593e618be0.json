When a thread is blocked on I/O, the OS knows not to switch it in. The biggest impact of unnecessary threads is actually their memory usage, particularly their kernel stack which cannot be swapped out and must be of a decent size due to the oddly recursive nature of device drivers on Windows.\r\n\r\n> can the worst usage of threads (including Thread.Sleep(1) in loops) influence other applications on the same machine?\r\n\r\nOh, sure. Not `Thread.Sleep` - that makes your thread pretty harmless. But if you were to start a bunch of threads that hog the CPU and turn their priority high, that would certainly impact other processes.","date":"2019-01-26T02:31:17.844Z"}
