The caller is the one that has the ability to call the method async and optionally cancel, or sync (and not have the ability to then cancel) without the library method needing to know anything other than that it accepts a cancellation token which could possibly be signaled, which jives with what you were saying in this post.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"fc376c57-b5a5-3648-80a6-be506f0156e2","date":"2015-03-26T02:08:04Z","timestamp":1427335684,"authorUserId":""}
