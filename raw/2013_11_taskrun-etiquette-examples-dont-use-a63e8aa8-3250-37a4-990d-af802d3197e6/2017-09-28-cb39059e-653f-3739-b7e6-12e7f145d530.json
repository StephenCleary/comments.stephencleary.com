And it may or may not be acceptable for ASP.NET apps.\r\n\r\nIn particular, Task.Run is OK (though I would argue not ideal) for abstracting platform implementations of operations that should be asynchronous. But that's not at all what this post is about; this post is about operations that are synchronous.\r\n\r\nThis post is dealing with the common problem where devs assume *everything* must be asynchronous. I'm searching a list for a string? Wrap it in Task.Run, and now it's an asynchronous search! I'm summing the values of an array? Wrap it in Task.Run, and now it's an asynchronous calculation!\r\n\r\nIn cases like these - where the operation is synchronous - wrapping the implementation in Task.Run and pretending it's asynchronous doesn't provide any benefit over the recommended solution of *calling* it via Task.Run.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"c360807d-30c4-3ddc-b986-bc9d48282819","date":"2017-09-28T13:42:32Z","timestamp":1506606152}
