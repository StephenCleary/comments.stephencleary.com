Your guides have managed to clear up all of the misconceptions/confusion I was having with it!\n\nYour posts are the gold standard against which all other programming guides should be measured. Clear examples that cover best practices and the \u003Ci\u003Erationale\u003C/i\u003E behind those practices, edge cases, pitfalls, it\u0027s all here. Thanks so much for your work!","date":"2023-10-12T15:57:11.4792857Z"}
