It seems to me that, whether it is an IO operation or a CPU bound operation, that a thread will have to be spawned at some point. Whether that happens internally as part of SaveChangesAsync in entity framework, or as a result of me calling Task.Run() somewhere doesn't at face value seem to me like it would change how [ASP.net](http://ASP.net \"ASP.net\") deals with the thread pool. Either way it seems like ASP.NET would have to deal with this \"The ASP.NET thread pool has to deal with (unexpectedly) losing one of its threads for the duration of this request.\" scenario.\r\n\r\nIt seems like it would be good practice to abstract away the call to Task.Run() as in your \"Using Task.Run for Asynchronous Wrappers\" example. Similar to how there is a SaveChanges and a SaveChangesAsync, if you don't want to use asynchronous then don't call the asynchronous method.\r\n\r\nIf I am wrong, then I have a fundamental misunderstanding somewhere about how this all works and would appreciate some clarification.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"","date":"2018-04-25T19:16:38Z","timestamp":1524683798,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_NNQAdRCoBK"}
