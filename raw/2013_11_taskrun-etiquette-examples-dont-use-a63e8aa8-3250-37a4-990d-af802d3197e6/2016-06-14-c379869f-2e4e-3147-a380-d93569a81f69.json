At least, that's how I approach it in all my writing.\r\n\r\nWhen I talk about \"UI\" in my articles, it's always referring to an actual Windows UI, complete with a message-pumping STA thread and thread-affine components. There's a lot of confusion out there where developers working on ASP.NET apps are literally thinking they act just like UI apps (I blame WebForms for a lot of this confusion - I've always taken the stance that abstracting away HTTP was a bad idea).\r\n\r\nSo, I treat \"returning early from ASP.NET requests\" as its own separate kind of problem ([http://blog.stephencleary.c...](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2014/06/fire-and-forget-on-asp-net.html) \"http://blog.stephencleary.com/2014/06/fire-and-forget-on-asp-net.html)\"). One significant reason is because Task.Run is a horrible solution for that problem.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"abf152e9-0f9d-3d40-8ec5-9b1a688fe896","date":"2016-06-14T09:32:27Z","timestamp":1465896747,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
