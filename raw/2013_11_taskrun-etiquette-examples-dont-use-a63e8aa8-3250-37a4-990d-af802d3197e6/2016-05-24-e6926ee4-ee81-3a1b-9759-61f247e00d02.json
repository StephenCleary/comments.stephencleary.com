That to me seems beneficial? However by doing the await Task.Run, you explained that we might ruin the [asp.net](http://asp.net) threadpool heuristics and therefore better to avoid. I get that. So , my question is instead of running the cpu bound code on [asp.net](http://asp.net) request thread and keeping it occupied in the cpu bound code, can I not push the cpu bound operation on to another thread(which is not a [asp.net](http://asp.net) thread). So, we get a win-win, we pushed off the computation to another thread(and the request thread can do other stuff) and we did not screw up the [asp.net](http://asp.net) heuristics because we didn't push it off to a [aps.net](http://aps.net) threadpool thread. In a nutshell, can we push off this cpu bound thread to a non [asp.net](http://asp.net) threadpool thread and free up the request thread?","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"77cda795-102d-3345-af82-5aac09b6a4f3","date":"2016-05-24T20:21:26Z","timestamp":1464121286,"authorUserId":""}
