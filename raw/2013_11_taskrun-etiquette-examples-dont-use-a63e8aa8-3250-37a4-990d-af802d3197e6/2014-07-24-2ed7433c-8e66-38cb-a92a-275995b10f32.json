The use of Parallel (or PLINQ) in ASP.NET is something I look at very skeptically. It can be useful in very rare scenarios if you're positive the number of simultaneous users is very low, but most of the time it's the wrong solution. Task.Run negatively impacts ASP.NET scalability, and Parallel/PLINQ negatively impacts ASP.NET scalability *a lot*.\r\n\r\nSometimes Parallel.ForEach (and friends) are applying the wrong solution to a problem, in particular, I've seen them misused to try to do I/O-bound work concurrently. Other times, the problem really would benefit from a parallel solution (i.e., it's CPU-bound), but even in those cases I'd consider a distributed system where ASP.NET just queues the work to be actually done by an independent system.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"dfee3e52-95ad-36a6-b0fa-2d5316c3078c","date":"2014-07-24T18:58:47Z","timestamp":1406228327,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
