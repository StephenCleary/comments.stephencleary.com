If you \"push\" the work off the request thread by doing `await Task.Run(() => ...)`, then you're taking another thread, scheduling the work to run on that thread, and then freeing up the request thread - instead of just running the work directly on the request thread. So it causes a thread context switch for no benefit (in fact, this technique will run slower and take up more resources for a short time).","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"e9674175-f2d3-3ef9-82b2-ee54f97b14ed","date":"2016-05-24T19:08:38Z","timestamp":1464116918}
