This is not a 'fake' async method it's just as real as any other method it's not as optimized as it could be but I have doubts about how bad this will perform. For front end apps this can be a excellent solution to deal with how different platforms handle background work, that way you can reuse your ViewModels and have different implementation of the service for different platforms. For server side you could still use this if you don't care about micro optimization but if you are just copy pasting your UI code and think you won't have problems this is the least of your problems.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"50e2989c-bc75-34df-8416-429a0df8278b","date":"2017-09-27T23:07:27Z","timestamp":1506553647,"authorUserId":"disqus:filipcordas"}
