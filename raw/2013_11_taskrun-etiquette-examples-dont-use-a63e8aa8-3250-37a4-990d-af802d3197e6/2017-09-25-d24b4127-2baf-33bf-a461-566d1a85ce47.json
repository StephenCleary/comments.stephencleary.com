Even in the none [Asp.net](http://Asp.net \"Asp.net\") example the code will be slower on a single core processor. It seams to me this is just for people that don't understand multithreading and has nothing to do with tasks. Threads by definition decrease performance so I don't understand what why would it be a surprise that this is the case with Task.Run. Making things parallel is what increases the performance. But I am more interested if this is really that big of a performance downfall or is it in reality a micro optimization.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"","date":"2017-09-25T10:10:09Z","timestamp":1506334209,"authorUserId":"disqus:filipcordas"}
