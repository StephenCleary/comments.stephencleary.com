My intention is actually let user have an intervention of variable  like   \r\n\r\n Step 1\r\nif (user requested changes)\r\n{\r\n   (Example)\r\n    ValueTobeUse= NewValue enter from dialog box\r\n}\r\nelse\r\n{\r\n    ValueToUse = A\r\n}\r\nStep2\r\nif (user requested changes)\r\n{\r\n   (Example)\r\n    ValueTobeUse= NewValue enter from dialog box\r\n}\r\nelse\r\n{\r\n    ValueToUse = B\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nImagine there are 10 steps to produce a cake in a production line in which all steps are in sequential mode, setting the cancellation token is just like throwing the whole ingredients away (: .   It is like pressing a Stop or Emergency Button.\r\n\r\nSo my objective is to allow user to change the variable as and when he believe it is necessary. Should I use a class level variable for NewValue ? It should work. But it is correct, as the above task will be continuous running until it complete the full cycle.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nSimon","date":"2021-02-10T15:15:05.528Z"}
