This method also does costly CPU bound operation after DB calls(once clsPlan gets populated) to set more another properties of same class. So, in conclusion, my call hierarchy would be like OpenPlan() Calls --> LoadPlan() and several another method related to view... LoadPLan() --> Several DB calls (private methods) and in-memory manipulation to populate clsPlan object.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"","date":"2017-08-14T07:53:08Z","timestamp":1502697188}
