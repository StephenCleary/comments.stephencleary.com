While I totally agree that Aurelia is better for two-way data binding, I disagree that two-way data binding is better.\r\n\r\nFull disclosure: I use both Aurelia and React regularly. They're both great frameworks.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend asking questions like this on Stack Overflow. I'm only at an \"OK\" level for both React and Aurelia, not an \"Expert\" level.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"c20227e6-bca0-3315-af34-cab5fe710454","date":"2016-10-14T13:28:21Z","timestamp":1476451701,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
