The page is a data-driven dashboard, so there's not really any way to split it up into multiple pages.\r\n\r\nWe did originally do the parallelism on the browser side - however our codebase is (unfortunately) deeply tied to the ASP.NET session object, so that our handler can only process one request per user at a time. So it looks like any parallelism will have to be on the server side, at least until the use of the session can be re-factored.\r\n\r\nI will try some Parallel implementations first, since it seems like a smaller code-base change than the TPL dataflow. Thankfully we're in a good position to do load testing and performance testing, so we should be able to tell objectively if the performance gain is worth the thread count increase.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thank you so much for your quick response!\r\n\r\nTom","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"5e2a02af-23d2-32f4-b33a-2dcd21fcebc4","date":"2015-03-10T21:25:16Z","timestamp":1426022716,"authorUserId":"disqus:thomastharp"}
