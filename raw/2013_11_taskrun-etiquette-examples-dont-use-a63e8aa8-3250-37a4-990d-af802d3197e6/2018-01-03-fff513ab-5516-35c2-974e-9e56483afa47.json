Since your operation is I/O bound (reading Azure blobs), it should be straightforward to start each download (getting a task instance for each download from the Azure client API), and then await Task.WhenAll on those tasks. This will give you a fully asynchronous approach.\r\n\r\nThe asynchronous approach will reduce your latency for that request, while also not reducing the responsiveness and scalability of your server as a whole.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"0893ef3b-1f51-38ca-9213-11e9c3dc4f9e","date":"2018-01-03T18:47:00Z","timestamp":1515005220}
