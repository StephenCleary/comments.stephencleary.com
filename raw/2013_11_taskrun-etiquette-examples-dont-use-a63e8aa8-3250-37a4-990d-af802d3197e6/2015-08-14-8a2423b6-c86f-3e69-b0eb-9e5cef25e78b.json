However, I never use it at the action level because of helper methods such as `View()`. If the `View()` method depends on any kind of request context (like writing response headers, or changing output based on request culture), then you may not get what you want.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, I always call ASP.NET methods from within a request context. So I don't use `ConfigureAwait(false)` in my action methods since they end with a call to an ASP.NET method.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, async/await will *increase* the time to serve a single request, but enables a higher total number of requests (assuming the backend can scale as well).","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use-a63e8aa8-3250-37a4-990d-af802d3197e6","replyTo":"f5ad6798-5446-3977-8166-1b51281f801f","date":"2015-08-14T13:51:16Z","timestamp":1439560276}
