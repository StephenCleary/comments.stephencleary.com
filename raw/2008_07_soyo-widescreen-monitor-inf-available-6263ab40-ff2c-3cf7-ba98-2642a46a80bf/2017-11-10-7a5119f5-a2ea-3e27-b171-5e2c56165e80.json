I installed the driver Stephen created and it didn't work. However, with the driver installed, I also changed the settings inside my AMD Catalyst Control Center (I have an AMD Video Card) and got it to work.\r\n\r\n1. Right click on the screen and select **<u>*\"Display Settings\"*</u>** in Windows 10.\r\n\r\n2. Select which monitor you are using if there is more than one monitor. (I had to select Monitor 2).\r\n\r\n3. Right click on the screen and select **<u>*\"AMD Control Center\"*</u>** in Windows 10.\r\n\r\n4. Under **<u>*\"My VGA Displays\"*</u>** in the AMD Control Center, I unselected **<u>*\"Use Extended Display Identification Data (EDID)*</u>**. I selected **<u>*1920x1200/60*</u>** Hz as the maximum resolution.\r\n\r\n5. Since my primary display is a 28\" monitor set at 1920x1200, I selected the 1680x1050 resolution on this 24\" monitor to make the windows and the characters practically equal in size.\r\n\r\nIt worked! Can you believe it took me ten years to figure this out? I've been using the 1600 settings this entire time.","postId":"2008_07_soyo-widescreen-monitor-inf-available-6263ab40-ff2c-3cf7-ba98-2642a46a80bf","replyTo":"a8ab456d-816d-33e9-a2e5-e6acd99067a7","date":"2017-11-10T14:13:27Z","timestamp":1510323207,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_4OuFK2a8Pd"}
