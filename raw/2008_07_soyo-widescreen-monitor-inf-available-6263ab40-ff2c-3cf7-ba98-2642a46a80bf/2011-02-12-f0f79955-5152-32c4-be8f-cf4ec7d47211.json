The device manager showed the monitor as Generic Non-PNP.   \r\n\r\nI tried the two inf solutions above, but neither seemed to work quite right. What did work was actually a bit easier...  \r\n\r\n1. Turn off computer and monitor.  \r\n2. UNPLUG monitor. Count to 10. Plug back in.  \r\n3. Turn everything back on.  \r\n4. The monitor now shows up in Device Manager as Generic PNP Monitor and I can set the proper resolution.","postId":"2008_07_soyo-widescreen-monitor-inf-available-6263ab40-ff2c-3cf7-ba98-2642a46a80bf","replyTo":"","date":"2011-02-12T10:40:31Z","timestamp":1297507231}
