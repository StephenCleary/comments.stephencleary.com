In many cases of lazy initialization, the factory function could be invoked from different contexts. This *could* create a race condition in some scenarios where the factory function may run on the UI thread *sometimes*, or on one of several ASP.NET contexts. To keep the context predictable, it is always run on a thread pool thread.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not always desirable either. So the current version of AsyncLazy<t> ( [https://github.com/StephenCleary/AsyncEx.Coordination/blob/master/src/Nito.AsyncEx.Coordination/AsyncLazy.cs](https://github.com/StephenCleary/AsyncEx.Coordination/blob/master/src/Nito.AsyncEx.Coordination/AsyncLazy.cs) ) takes a flag argument that allows you to skip the Task.Run call.","postId":"2012_08_asynchronous-lazy-initialization-248a82a4-1ad6-39c8-867f-974206a56b23","replyTo":"7ca88b7e-62da-3b91-bf66-28346cf67748","date":"2016-10-31T13:13:50Z","timestamp":1477919630}
