In a zip file, each file entry is sequential, so it's not possible to stream multiple entries at a time. Zip is an ancient file format, not at all like mkv or something which is capable of multiplexing.\r\n\r\nIf your bottleneck is the *download*, then you can certainly do the downloads concurrently. But they could only be added to the zip stream one at a time. So you're potentially increasing your memory usage since you'd be buffering the other entries in memory as they wait their turn.","date":"2019-01-20T01:15:28.964Z"}
