Sometimes it brings forth net::INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING error and does not complete the download. I noticed this only happens to some devs, not everyone. Also, I tried using the logger available on the FileResultExecutorBase to send any exceptions to application insights with no success... Do you have know any possible reasons for this?","date":"2022-04-26T21:15:02.739Z"}
