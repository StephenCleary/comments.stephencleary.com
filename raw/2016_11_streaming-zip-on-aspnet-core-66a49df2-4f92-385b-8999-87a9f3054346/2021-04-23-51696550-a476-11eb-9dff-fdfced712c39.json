The scheme works great. One thing I have recently tried to do was have a zip archive nested within the main zip that gets downloaded. I just create a new ZipArchive as an entry in that main zip. Then I stream files to be contained in that nested zip. Everything works fine and is included in the download, but with one caveat. While files are being streamed into that nested zip, there is no download activity. It waits until all files have been streamed to that nested zip before continuing with the download. Any idea of how I could make the streaming of those nested zip files continuous as they are in the main zip? Appreciate any help. Thanks","date":"2021-04-23T20:56:04.697Z"}
