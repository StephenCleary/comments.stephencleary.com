The versioning and the packaging (what includes what) is a bit confusing\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nETA: I verified that I am running .NET Runtime 2.0.5 and the SDK is 2.1.4. That is what the Jan 12/13 release was.","postId":"2016_11_streaming-zip-on-aspnet-core-66a49df2-4f92-385b-8999-87a9f3054346","replyTo":"d896cb77-2fec-338d-9993-7e73657e295a","date":"2018-02-08T19:31:45Z","timestamp":1518118305}
