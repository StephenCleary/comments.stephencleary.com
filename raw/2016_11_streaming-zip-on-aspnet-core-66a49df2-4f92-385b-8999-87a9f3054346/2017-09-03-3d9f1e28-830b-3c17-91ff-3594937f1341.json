In order to do that you have to know what value to set it to - before sending the data. So you can't zip on-the-fly anymore. You'd have to zip up the whole response in-memory (or on-disk) first, then set the pre-zipped response. So you'd use something like FileContentResult (in-memory) or FileStreamResult (on-disk) instead of the approach in this blog post.","postId":"2016_11_streaming-zip-on-aspnet-core-66a49df2-4f92-385b-8999-87a9f3054346","replyTo":"3896eb96-005d-3057-aaf1-900cb0479c40","date":"2017-09-03T23:28:06Z","timestamp":1504481286}
