I am busy with a normal file downloader, in our case video files. We are using Asp.Net core. In our old project we used to to the whole thing to check for ranges and the chunking a byte array to the UI. However in Asp.Net core I tried to use FileStreamResult but did not work as expected. I used your example above but could not get it to work properly. The problem with the FileStreamResult is that it doesn't look like you have control over the \"Content-Length\" thus t he browser cannot calculate the estimate download duration making it an awkward implementation as the user only sees the current download size and not what is left.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to achieve is fetching a videostream from Azure blob storage and sending that down to the client in an asynchronous way. Can you please give some direction here.\r\n\r\nThanks","postId":"2016_11_streaming-zip-on-aspnet-core-66a49df2-4f92-385b-8999-87a9f3054346","replyTo":"","date":"2017-07-14T12:58:35Z","timestamp":1500037115}
