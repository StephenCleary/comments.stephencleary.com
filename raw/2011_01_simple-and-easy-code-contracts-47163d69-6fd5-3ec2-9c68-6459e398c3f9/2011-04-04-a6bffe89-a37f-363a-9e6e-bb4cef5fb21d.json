One thing that I cannot get to work is the static checking when referencing the assembly (which has ccs defined) instead of referencing the project (which has ccs defined).  \r\n\r\nReferencing the project in Visual Studio only works for me (because I have the source code), but not everyone who might only get the assembly.  \r\n\r\nThe runtime checking works fine in both scenarios, but the static checking does not pick up the ccs. Have you had that issue?  \r\n\r\nLars","postId":"2011_01_simple-and-easy-code-contracts-47163d69-6fd5-3ec2-9c68-6459e398c3f9","replyTo":"","date":"2011-04-04T12:24:49Z","timestamp":1301919889}
