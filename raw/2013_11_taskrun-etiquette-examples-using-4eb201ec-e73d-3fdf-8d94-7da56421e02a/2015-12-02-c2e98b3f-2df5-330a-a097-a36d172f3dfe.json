Regardless, i recognize it is a matter of taste, but it looks like a code smell to me. Maybe suppressing the \"statement not awaited\" warning locally (CS4014, NOT CS0414) is the best way, but still awful. Could you think of any way to avoid where I landed, taking the overall goal into consideration? Or is this the one time Task.Run makes sense for an IO bound task?\r\n\r\nThanks for an interesting discussion, would really love to know how to make things pretty like i usually strive to ;)","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-using-4eb201ec-e73d-3fdf-8d94-7da56421e02a","replyTo":"e16e9ae0-f918-3a13-a6a0-578ba48a8514","date":"2015-12-02T21:10:15Z","timestamp":1449090615}
