I could disable warnings, but both solutions seems sort of hacky to me. I find that I very often run into this pattern that deserves a prettier solution; Doing stuff that is not related to current function but should run in current synchronisation context. To me, it seems like the async await library is the first major C# feature that isn't fully thought through. Unless I'm missing something and should think differently to solve the problem the function above attempts to.\r\n\r\nThanks again ;)  \r\nAnders","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-using-4eb201ec-e73d-3fdf-8d94-7da56421e02a","replyTo":"84c7f830-8ab0-3c97-8abc-2845cb38e4b0","date":"2015-12-02T17:05:05Z","timestamp":1449075905,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_czcHhkHzPx"}
