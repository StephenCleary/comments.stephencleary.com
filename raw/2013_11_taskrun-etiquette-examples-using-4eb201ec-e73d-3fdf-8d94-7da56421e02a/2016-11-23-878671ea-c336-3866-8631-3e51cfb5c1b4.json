However, if that is not an option, then you should first file an issue with whatever client library you're using to support asynchronous APIs, and then go ahead and use Task.Run to push the blocking work onto a threadpool thread. This is not the best use case for Task.Run, but is a perfectly good workaround for improper API design (for UI apps only - not for ASP.NET apps).\r\n\r\nThe blocked thread is not going to take a core; it acts like any other thread in a wait state and will be swapped out.\r\n\r\nHowever, when you do use Task.Run, I recommend using Task.Run to *call* the synchronous APIs; using Task.Run to implement fake-asynchronous wrappers for those synchronous APIs is highly questionable, design-wise:\r\n\r\n[http://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/11/taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use.html](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/11/taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use.html)  \r\n[https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pfxteam/2012/03/24/should-i-expose-asynchronous-wrappers-for-synchronous-methods/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pfxteam/2012/03/24/should-i-expose-asynchronous-wrappers-for-synchronous-methods/)","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-using-4eb201ec-e73d-3fdf-8d94-7da56421e02a","replyTo":"d52e1275-e85d-3f9b-9fa2-25f38a5c0ad3","date":"2016-11-23T14:03:32Z","timestamp":1479909812}
