Task.Run is an acceptable workaround for UI apps in this situation, but it's pointless for ASP.NET.  \r\n\r\nYou'll need to contact the library maintainers and ask them for async support. In the meantime, just call it synchronously (\"var success = ConvertToTiff(filename)\"). ASP.NET will work fine if your threads do block - and it handles that situation very well - it just won't scale as well as an actual asynchronous method.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-using-4eb201ec-e73d-3fdf-8d94-7da56421e02a","replyTo":"","date":"2014-04-24T00:28:41Z","timestamp":1398299321,"authorUserId":""}
