I do use this pattern in UI apps, but I wouldn't put it in an ASP.NET app.\r\n\r\nYou can get away with some parallel processing on ASP.NET, but bear in mind you're now using multiple threads per request instead of just 1 or 0. This can decrease your scalability significantly, especially in bursting traffic scenarios. I'd only do this if you're sure your usage will be low and stay low.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I *have* done this on ASP.NET, thinking that I knew better etc. etc. and got burned by it. Recently, too - just a few months ago. Sigh. :/","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-using-4eb201ec-e73d-3fdf-8d94-7da56421e02a","replyTo":"b56d8934-e044-3517-960a-29fad7428d88","date":"2016-06-03T00:12:07Z","timestamp":1464912727,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
