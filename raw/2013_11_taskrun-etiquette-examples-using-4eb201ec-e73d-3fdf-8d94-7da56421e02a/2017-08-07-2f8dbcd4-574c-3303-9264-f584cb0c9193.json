I did not realize that the context is not passed to the threadpool thread....though it would make sense, since the execution is blocked, there is no need for a reference on where to resume.\r\n\r\nAgree on the bad practice. We are updating this code...I wanted to understand the deadlock scenario.\r\n\r\nOne last question... if you call .Result on an async method that is awaited.. does it block the main thread? Again I've googled this but I cant find an exact answer and my understanding of .Result is that it blocks. However when combined with await, I'm unsure of the side effects. My intuition tells me that the await call creates the pointer in the sync context and .Result isnt actually called until the Task completes so it wouldnt block. But I honestly dont know. I dont think calling .Result is appropriate anyway, but I'd like to understand what is happening?\r\n\r\nSuch as:  \r\nvar result = await httpClient.GetAysnc(url).Result;\r\n\r\nThanks!","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-using-4eb201ec-e73d-3fdf-8d94-7da56421e02a","replyTo":"c283337d-d392-3a84-94c6-cd0681dc2fd7","date":"2017-08-07T21:40:25Z","timestamp":1502142025,"authorUserId":"disqus:ariaroller"}
