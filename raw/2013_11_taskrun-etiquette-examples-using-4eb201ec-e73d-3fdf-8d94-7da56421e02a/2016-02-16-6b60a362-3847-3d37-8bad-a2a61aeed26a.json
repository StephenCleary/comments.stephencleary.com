UI apps have the entire thread pool at their disposal; ASP.NET requests have to be more careful since they share the pool with others. This is why I do not recommend Task.Run in any reusable/generic library code.\r\n\r\nIn your case, you could probably just use a single Task.Run at the top and that would be fine. I wouldn't worry about the blocking calls further down because they'd just be blocking a thread pool thread.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-using-4eb201ec-e73d-3fdf-8d94-7da56421e02a","replyTo":"d30b69d9-ffd6-37e5-9a57-df12742717a3","date":"2016-02-16T13:11:09Z","timestamp":1455628269,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
