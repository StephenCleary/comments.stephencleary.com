In the meantime I've found your article [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn605875.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn605875.aspx) about MVVM. I think this is much closer to my situation. I still have to study what you write.... There is an interesting part about binding and async in mvvm: that's what I'm talking about. (Side note, off topic: your attitude towards mvvm is a bit surprising to me, while I'm striving to understand and apply attached dependency properties and so on...). Back to the point. In that article you write: NotifyTaskCompletion<t>.Result is data-binding friendly: it answers a key part of my question... Thanks, I'll try to follow that link.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-using-4eb201ec-e73d-3fdf-8d94-7da56421e02a","replyTo":"3d5c9354-0fc1-3e68-9d21-7ca3c7c18413","date":"2016-04-30T07:20:06Z","timestamp":1462000806}
