The obvious exceptions are SignalR-style apps and apps with very-high-latency backend services which still support a lot of throughput. Very rare and in those cases I'd just use async for a small part of the code.  \r\n\r\nYour comments regarding events and Rx are true. Still, async has fundamental debugging problems. For example the logical stack is not available and you can't pause the debugger to see what all the (IO-based) tasks are doing. It is actually quite awful if you're used to inspecting a running system.
