Sure, someone can tweak the thread pool if they need to scale, but how many ASP.NET programmers know to do that? And even with tweaking, async code can scale an order of magnitude higher than threads.  \r\n\r\nHowever, I definitely have to agree regarding debugging. FYI, there are ETW events that were added to track async/await. They're not documented yet, but they're in the runtime. I expect that we'll see some better visualizations and debugging helpers in future updates that build on this.","postId":"2013_02_async-oop-5-events-d852aaf4-5a90-3727-b614-43875912fa95","replyTo":"","date":"2013-03-04T08:22:20Z","timestamp":1362385340,"authorUserId":""}
