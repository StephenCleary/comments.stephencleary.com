However, they are often useful in a UI application. So what I usually end up doing is having all my async void methods be exactly one line long. They all look like this:\r\n\r\n async void SomeEventHandler(object sender, EventArgsOrWhatever args)  \r\n {  \r\n await SomeEventHandlerAsync(sender, args);  \r\n }\r\n\r\n async Task SomeEventHandlerAsync(object sender, EventArgsOrWhatever args)  \r\n {  \r\n ... // Actual handling logic  \r\n }\r\n\r\nThen the \"async Task\" version is unit testable, composable, etc. The \"async void' handler isn't, but that's acceptable since it no longer has any real logic at all.","postId":"2013_02_async-oop-5-events-d852aaf4-5a90-3727-b614-43875912fa95","replyTo":"f1874075-76d5-38c0-b84b-38b4cd980f29","date":"2015-11-08T23:17:23Z","timestamp":1447024643}
