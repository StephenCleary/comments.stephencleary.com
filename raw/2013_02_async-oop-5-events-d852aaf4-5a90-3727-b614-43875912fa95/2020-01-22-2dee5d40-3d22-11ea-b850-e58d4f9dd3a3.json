In AsyncEx 5.0, this is how I did it:\r\n\r\n    public class MyEventArgs : EventArgs\r\n    {\r\n      private readonly DeferralManager deferrals = new DeferralManager();\r\n\r\n      ... // Your own constructors and properties.\r\n\r\n      public IDisposable GetDeferral()\r\n      {\r\n        return deferrals.DeferralSource.GetDeferral();\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      internal Task WaitForDeferralsAsync()\r\n      {\r\n        return deferrals.WaitForDeferralsAsync();\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHope it looks good :)","date":"2020-01-22T14:19:20.170Z"}
