Event handlers were designed from a sync perspective, and that's why using them with async is awkward.  \r\n\r\nMore modern approaches like Rx really reveal the drawbacks of C# events. I think if events were added to C# now, they would look very, very different (and naturally work great with async).","postId":"2013_02_async-oop-5-events-d852aaf4-5a90-3727-b614-43875912fa95","replyTo":"","date":"2013-03-03T02:46:23Z","timestamp":1362278783,"authorUserId":""}
