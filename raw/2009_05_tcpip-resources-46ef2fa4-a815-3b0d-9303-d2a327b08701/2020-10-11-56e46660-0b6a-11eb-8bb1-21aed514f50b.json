As long as there is a new network path by the time the next packet is sent, the connection just continues working on the new path.\r\n\r\nI suspect what you may be observing is a special behavior Microsoft added to their OS: if a network cable is physically disconnected from the computer, Windows will immediately error-out any sockets using that connection. I don't think this \"feature\" can be disabled.","date":"2020-10-11T02:34:51.957Z"}
