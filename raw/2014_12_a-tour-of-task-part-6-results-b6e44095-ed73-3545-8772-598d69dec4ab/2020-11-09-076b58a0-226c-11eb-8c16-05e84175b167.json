Sincerely, thank you. :-)\r\n\r\nA really quick question, please. \r\n\r\nI am having a hard time finding the answer for is it safe to access .Result if the task is completed already? I am using a .WhenAny(...) inside a while loop to iterate through a collection of tasks for which I do not care when they finish, but just want to process results ASAP. I'm reasoning that await would be overhead in this specific scenario? But that is just my assumption.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nV.","date":"2020-11-09T09:14:54.402Z"}
