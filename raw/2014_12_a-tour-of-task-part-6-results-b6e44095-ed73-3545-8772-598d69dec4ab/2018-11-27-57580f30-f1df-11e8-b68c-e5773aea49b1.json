They're a lot like Console apps if they do have a main thread, and it's normal to block that thread on whatever operation you're doing. That's not the only option, though; you can have a Win32 service that does not have a main thread.\r\n\r\nOne approach I've taken with Win32 services is to have a synchronous main thread but keep everything else asynchronous, e.g., `AsyncContextThread` from my [AsyncEx library](https://github.com/StephenCleary/AsyncEx). But if you don't need to synchronize your code all onto a single thread, then you wouldn't even need the main thread.","date":"2018-11-27T00:56:58.534Z"}
