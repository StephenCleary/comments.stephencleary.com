It's purely an implementation detail. In your example, a Person will be sent, not a Task<person>.\r\n\r\nYou can verify this by not using the service contract on the client side. If you generate your proxy instead of using the service contract, you'll get methods that return both Person and Task<person>, and this is true whether your server function returns Person or Task<person>. This is one reason I'm not wild about the way WCF reuses service contract interfaces: it exposes this implementation detail.","postId":"2012_08_async-wcf-today-and-tomorrow-962c9b7d-5731-340e-90d7-2697f0bef315","replyTo":"a64ec8ef-2f2d-32ee-b7ba-fe3991d8fd7d","date":"2018-02-21T13:34:08Z","timestamp":1519220048}
