You should be able to use await with Task.Factory.FromAsync wrappers around HttpWebRequest's Begin/End methods (see [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh873178(v=vs.110).aspx#ApmToTap](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh873178(v=vs.110).aspx#ApmToTap) ).\r\n\r\nHowever, it may be easier to use HttpClient, which wraps HttpWebRequest. Also, it seems to me that sending keepalive messages may work better than setting SO_KEEPALIVE, but I'm not familiar with that exact SNAT problem.","postId":"2012_08_async-wcf-today-and-tomorrow-962c9b7d-5731-340e-90d7-2697f0bef315","replyTo":"91f51b08-ea36-3d2b-a703-ece742cc427b","date":"2017-03-28T14:17:02Z","timestamp":1490710622}
