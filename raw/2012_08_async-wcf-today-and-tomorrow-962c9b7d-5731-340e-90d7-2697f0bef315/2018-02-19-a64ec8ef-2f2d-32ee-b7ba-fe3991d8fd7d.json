Thanks for great post !!\r\n\r\nWith in a same process I can understand how async/await works - like await on task will free up thread and once await on that task is completed, some thread from thread pool will be assigned to continue execution of program following await statement.\r\n\r\nHowever how all this play across boundaries am not able to visualize. For example If wcf service contract says Task<person> GetPerson(int id) - once server side operation of fetching person record is done successfully , does WCF run time returns Task<person> object in SOAP body (with IsCompleted = true) ?\r\n\r\nIf yes, client side run time upon receiving task<person> as completed allocates thread to continue client side execution following await statement ?\r\n\r\nOr WCF run time just returns Person object in SOAP response packet ?\r\n\r\nJust a little background : I have been using shared service contracts and custom WCF client channel using channel manager for communication vs auto generated proxy. Since certain DB related I/O operations on server were time consuming, I made them async and updated my shared service contract from Person to Task<person>.","postId":"2012_08_async-wcf-today-and-tomorrow-962c9b7d-5731-340e-90d7-2697f0bef315","replyTo":"","date":"2018-02-19T14:37:51Z","timestamp":1519051071,"authorUserId":"disqus:rahulagarawal"}
