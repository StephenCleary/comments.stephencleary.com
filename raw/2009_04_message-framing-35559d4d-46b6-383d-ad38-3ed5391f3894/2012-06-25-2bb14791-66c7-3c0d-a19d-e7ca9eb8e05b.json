Target is the same: Transfer messages over unsecure connection by handling a tcp stream with a small protocol (length coded or with delimiters). But now there is an additional level that client and server have to make decisions after which time they assume a connection loss and decide to make a reconnect. Did you manage problems like this ?  \r\nMarkus","postId":"2009_04_message-framing-35559d4d-46b6-383d-ad38-3ed5391f3894","replyTo":"","date":"2012-06-25T10:23:55Z","timestamp":1340619835,"authorUserId":""}
