The same socket class can be used for datagram sockets (UDP/IP), which do use \"message\" terminology but they don't have the concept of a partial message read - you either read the entire message or you don't get any of it.\r\n\r\nI can't find any of the MSDN docs that talk about Socket.Receive returning 0 for a \"message completed\" or returning -1 for an error code.
