Based on my tests. The back-and-forth communication between server and client does help to stabilize the data transfer ('stablize' means that no data is lost during socket streaming). But if the data size for each send/receive call should be small, for example 1024 bytes. If each time I wanted to transfer 6000 bytes, I got errors. Not sure about the best solution for this problem.   \r\n\r\nI wrote a class to perform data exchange between server and client. My method is similar to the prefix method since each time I send a short message about the information about a big array that I will send to the client. Then in the class I compute the number of passes I need to call 'send', etc.  \r\n\r\n So far I am satisfied with the performance. Does any one want to test my class? I can share it by putting it on my Google documents.  \r\n\r\nJuefu","postId":"2009_04_message-framing-35559d4d-46b6-383d-ad38-3ed5391f3894","replyTo":"","date":"2011-11-22T07:21:00Z","timestamp":1321946460,"authorUserId":""}
