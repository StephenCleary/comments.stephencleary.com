However I read somewhere in the MSDN docs (I can't find the page now!) that seemed to suggest that when zero bytes is read via Socket.Receive(), it can be interpreted as \"you've received the entire message\". Is this incorrect (or at least a little naive)?\r\n\r\nI'm looking to implement a request/response scenario, initially without message framing. Based on what I read, I was hoping I could write the request then go into a loop that repeatedly calls Socket.Receive(), appending the data to a buffer, until zero bytes is received.\r\n\r\nLastly, the Socket.Receive() MSDN docs mention that a return value of -1 means that \"the call was unsuccessful\". What do they mean by this? Wouldn't it just throw an exception if something went wrong?","postId":"2009_04_message-framing-35559d4d-46b6-383d-ad38-3ed5391f3894","replyTo":"","date":"2015-02-20T11:34:48Z","timestamp":1424432088}
