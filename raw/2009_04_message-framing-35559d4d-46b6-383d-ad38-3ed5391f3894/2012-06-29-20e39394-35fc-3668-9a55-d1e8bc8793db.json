Conceptually, it's just an abstraction layer.  \r\n\r\nThe systems I did were quite complex due to timeouts and error recovery requirements. In modern-day code (particularly with async/await), I think this kind of system would be much simpler.  \r\n\r\nIdempotent commands really help in situations like this.","postId":"2009_04_message-framing-35559d4d-46b6-383d-ad38-3ed5391f3894","replyTo":"","date":"2012-06-29T23:32:53Z","timestamp":1341012773,"authorUserId":""}
