It\u0027s just an assumption that a sender package will be received as is delivered. Often not remind is, that internet topology does not use TCP/IP as the transport protocol. There are several different network protocols in use and has a different behavior as TCP/IP.\nThis often starts behind the gateway router. We use DSL / ATM / SDN /PDM and some other protocols that use quite different parameters compared by TCP/IP. MTU/MSS and the fragment aspect are only valid for TCP/IP. Other protocols support smaller or bigger frames and share the containment with several other data types and sources. It would be magic, if a full-filled Ethernet frame delivered by a sender, will be received in the same full-filled packed at the destination.\n","date":"2025-08-29T15:13:31.4521399Z"}
