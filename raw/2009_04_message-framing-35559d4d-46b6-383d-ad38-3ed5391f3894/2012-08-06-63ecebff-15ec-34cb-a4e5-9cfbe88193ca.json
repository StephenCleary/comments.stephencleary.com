TCP/IP itself guarantees that no data will be \"lost.\" If you lose data, the connection is broken. This is true on all platforms (Windows/Linux/whatever). TCP/IP will split up the stream into packets on the wire and re-assemble them in the correct order automatically on the other side. There's no length restriction on TCP/IP data. Perhaps you're using UDP/IP?","postId":"2009_04_message-framing-35559d4d-46b6-383d-ad38-3ed5391f3894","replyTo":"68d31e77-e57d-3fd3-81a9-15c587762dd5","date":"2012-08-06T23:26:07Z","timestamp":1344295567}
