With MVVM, you end up with two components where there should only be one. There's a direct analogy in the C# world: Views and ViewModels in WPF, which do have the same problems as views and viewmodels in JS.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I'm not against MVVM. I'm currently playing with a project that uses Redux with Aurelia, and it's interesting.","postId":"2016_02_why-react-why-redux-426204a1-cf4b-312a-8999-d6adcc021e7a","replyTo":"fbd0d73c-ce20-398d-a167-05b121d8c782","date":"2016-02-16T13:17:45Z","timestamp":1455628665}
