Async can call sync and sync async, but it's not recommended and can cause unpredictable issues.\r\n\r\n-  If at the highest level (Main, UI Events, MVC routes, unit tests) async is not supported you need to break on async code.\r\n\r\n- If at the lowest level async is not supported you won't get any benefit and will have to break.\r\n\r\n- So if you are writing an API or framework you now need to write async and sync, or half of developers can't really use your code properly.\r\n\r\n- If you think a synchronous model is a better fit or have to support a synchronous legacy API; tough! The async / sync boundary will always have problems, and it seems we have set them up in a fight to the death..","date":"2019-09-14T13:50:54.368Z"}
