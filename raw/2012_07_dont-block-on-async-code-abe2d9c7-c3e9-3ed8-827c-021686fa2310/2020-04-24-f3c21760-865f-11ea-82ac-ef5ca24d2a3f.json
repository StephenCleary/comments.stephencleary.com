However, that's not always possible; sometimes you just have to block. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2015/july/async-programming-brownfield-async-development for techniques when going purely `async` isn't possible.\r\n\r\nOne important thing to realize is that there's no benefit for asynchronous code for your situation. The thread is not actually yielded unless you use `async` all the way up. Looking at it from the other direction: since the delegate is synchronous, a thread *must* be blocked; there is no other possibility.\r\n\r\nDepending on your code base, it may make more sense to block on asynchronous code or it may make more sense to be synchronous all the way. In terms of benefits both are equivalent; since a thread is blocked, you won't get any of the asynchronous benefits either way.","date":"2020-04-24T19:15:26.128Z"}
