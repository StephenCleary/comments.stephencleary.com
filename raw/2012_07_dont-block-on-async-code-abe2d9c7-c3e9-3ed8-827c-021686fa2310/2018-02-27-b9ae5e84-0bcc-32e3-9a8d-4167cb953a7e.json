Just one question. The deadlock was not always happening, but rather intermittently. This is in ASP.Net WebAPI.\r\n\r\nGiven we were not using ConfigureAwait(false), does it mean that the context that the task after completion re-enters into is sometimes a different [ASP.net](http://ASP.net) thread (which is when we do not get a deadlock) and sometimes is the same ASP.Net thread (in which case we do get a deadlock)?","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2018-02-27T13:02:07Z","timestamp":1519736527,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_ZZpGv0gXZl"}
