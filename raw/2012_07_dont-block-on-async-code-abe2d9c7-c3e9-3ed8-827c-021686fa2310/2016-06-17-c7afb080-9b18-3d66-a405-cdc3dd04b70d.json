And the \"thread has exited\" statements don't mean anything useful in this case; you can just ignore them.\r\n\r\nI recommend that you:  \r\n1) Reduce the code causing the deadlock down to the minimum possible code that still causes the deadlock.  \r\n2) Post a question on Stack Overflow with *all* of the code necessary to reproduce the issue.  \r\n3) Send me a link to the question.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"25847a80-373b-3aea-8482-7bbd80edeebc","date":"2016-06-17T19:02:21Z","timestamp":1466190141}
