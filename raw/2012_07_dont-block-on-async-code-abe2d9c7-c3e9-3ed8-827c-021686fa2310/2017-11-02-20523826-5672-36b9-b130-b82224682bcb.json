But it's really hard to say for sure without a code sample that illustrates the problem.\r\n\r\nPlease reduce the code to the minimum necessary to reproduce the problem and post it on Stack Overflow. There's a lot of smart people there and someone will probably be able to find it very quickly.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"dddb43ef-29c5-3993-83c1-37d6981913c7","date":"2017-11-02T21:38:58Z","timestamp":1509658738}
