They are super useful.  \r\n\r\nI have a question for you. In your code solution 2 above  \r\n\r\npublic class MyController : ApiController  \r\n{  \r\n public async Task Get()  \r\n {  \r\n var json = await GetJsonAsync(...);  \r\n return json.ToString();  \r\n }  \r\n}  \r\n\r\nNow if you make the Get() method async and you call GetJsonAsync() and if this method is a long running process, wouldn't the request just return back to the client without actually waiting for the GetJsonAsync() call to complete. Could you please shed some light on this.  \r\n\r\nThanks.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2014-03-14T20:47:48Z","timestamp":1394830068}
