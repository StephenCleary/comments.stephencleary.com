It doesn't matter whether we call it a pattern, an API or give it a name like \"solution\". The point is that developers, 20 years later, are still completely put off by all of these nonsensical software design required to interact with a UI and data. I mean look at the disaster of XAML and how much of that is just not quite enough, and then when you need code, you have to peel away huge amounts of XAML, translate that into code, just so that you can do a little bit of something that XAML or declarative programming doesn't support.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"1c978b71-601c-3295-9736-e482ad3a1ae7","date":"2017-09-17T01:18:14Z","timestamp":1505611094,"authorUserId":"disqus:greggwon"}
