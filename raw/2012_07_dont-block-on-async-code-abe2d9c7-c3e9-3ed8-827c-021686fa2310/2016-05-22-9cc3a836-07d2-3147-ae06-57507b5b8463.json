In my case, the client.Timeout goes up to 3 minutes and only then throws a System.Net.WebException - Connection timed out - as described in my post at StackOverflow ([http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37369180/async-download-and-deserialize)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37369180/async-download-and-deserialize)) .\r\n\r\nI tried to base myself in some of your book recommendations, namely 2.1 - Pausing for a Period of Time - Discussion, where you say that CancellationToken is usually a better choice for a timeout; and 9.3 - Canceling Due to Timeouts - Solution, where you show some token timeout examples. However, the CancellingToken is being ignored when the host is unreachable; works fine otherwise (i.e., if the whole download and deserialization process isn't completed in 10 seconds). Still, the (real) problem seems to be in GetAsync method.\r\n\r\nMind to take a look? Thanks! Your blog posts and book have definitely been helpful thus far.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2016-05-22T15:38:16Z","timestamp":1463931496,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_LfgagoSDen"}
