Windows still requires a \"special STA UI thread\" and probably always will, and that's a pain.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of WPF, they tried hard to separate this out. There's still holdovers of this attempt in the \"visual tree\" vs \"logical tree\" - the original idea was to have devs access the logical tree from any thread, and those updates would be \"reflected\" to the visual tree that is owned by the STA thread. They were hoping to move all of that \"special STA UI thread\" stuff to be behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, they didn't make it, possibly due to time constraints. To my knowledge, no one else has tried since.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"a7a5560f-9ee9-375f-ade5-a9d45da44c94","date":"2017-09-18T21:25:09Z","timestamp":1505769909,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
