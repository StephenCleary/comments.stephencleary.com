The VS debugger will take special actions to allow you to \"step\" naturally through async code, which is why I asked about whether you're stepping through your methods.\r\n\r\nRegardless, as long as your DB queries are truly asynchronous, then they should all be running concurrently. If you have any warnings saying \"this async method lacks await operators and will run synchronously\", then it's not actually asynchronous and won't be concurrent.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"290d5ea3-4e28-3a19-8866-37060145d8f3","date":"2016-06-24T20:07:13Z","timestamp":1466798833,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
