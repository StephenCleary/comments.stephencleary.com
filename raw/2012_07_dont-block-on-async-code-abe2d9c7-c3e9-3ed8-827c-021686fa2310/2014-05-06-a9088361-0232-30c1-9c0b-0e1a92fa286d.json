So, in your example, if GetStringAsync does not need the context after the call to SaveChangesAsync, then it should use ConfigureAwait(false). The same goes for the caller of GetStringAsync, etc.  \r\n\r\nYou'll find that ConfigureAwait(false) ends up being in every async method that does not need the context. This can actually act like a kind of divider in your code; e.g., if a ConfigureAwait(false) method is in your UI layer, maybe it should move into a library; and if a non-ConfigureAwait(false) method is in a library or domain layer, then it should probably be moved out or refactored to use IProgress instead.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2014-05-06T16:16:22Z","timestamp":1399392982}
