But as far as I could see once a method is called and the method call break point is hit , it immediately goes to the next DAL layer break point for that corresponding method. But accordingly , should not all the serviceclass methods breakpoints be hit one by one , and then the Debugger move to the DAL layer for any of the methods ?\r\n\r\nAnd , the main concern is , Why is await.WhenAll(task1,task2,taks3) immediately returning to the invoking controller ?\r\n\r\nI have not yet got the results .. and hence I am inevitably getting null as the controller returns results back to the UI side ? How can I avoid it ? Wait for all the tasks to asynchronously and then wait for all the results to come back and then only return the consolidated result back to Controller , so the Controller now can return successfully to UI ?\r\n\r\nPlease help.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"116137f5-c2b0-3b36-8f85-729a3b46630c","date":"2016-06-26T19:11:04Z","timestamp":1466968264,"authorUserId":""}
