So the switch back to the UI context at the end of the await (i.e. when you omit .ConfigureAwait(false)) wasn't not really accomplishing much in the first place. You could have ConfigureAwait(false) and still update the UI from within GetJsonAsync, for example. Agree?","date":"2020-08-09T14:39:27.286Z"}
