And from a client's perspective, I couldn't care less how a component is implemented, all I care of is when the result is available.\r\n\r\nIf all my code is synchronous so far, no component should force that to change. I am in charge of my architecture, not a component from [nuget.org](http://nuget.org).\r\n\r\nIt's a shame there is no safety by design here. Calling Wait() or Result on the same thread should throw an exception. No async code should run on the main thread. I know thread management brings overhead, but we can afford one extra. Anything else is an optimization and should be controlled explicitly.\r\n\r\nI've wasted hours to pinpoint that call to Result. It would have been so much better if I got an exception telling me to run that async call on a different thread, or if the runtime just did it.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"44e38063-900c-34eb-b8c3-4865de7b26ce","date":"2015-09-17T12:47:55Z","timestamp":1442494075,"authorUserId":"disqus:thomaseyde"}
