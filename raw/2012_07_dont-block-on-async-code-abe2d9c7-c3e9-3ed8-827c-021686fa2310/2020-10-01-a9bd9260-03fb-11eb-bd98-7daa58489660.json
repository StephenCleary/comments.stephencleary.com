I have a wpf application which works on sync manner.  It has a DataGrid which displays rows from a db view. There is pagination, so there are next, prev buttons, or you can provide the page number. Some db view takes several seconds to calculate so I thought to add async methods, so a loading sign can be displayed while waiting for the db. (Your blog convinced me that BackgroundWorker is not the answer)\r\n\r\nHere are my problems, I start from sync code at page change and call async method which is not a good practice as I understand; ActualPageNumber is a data-bound property which setter should start an async operation (I read this is again a big no, no). \r\n\r\nDo you may have some small example async application, which can help to understand better how to add async parts to a sync program.","date":"2020-10-01T15:34:58.756Z"}
