I agree completely with that.\r\n\r\nHowever, consider this: in the same A -> B -> C -> D scenario, then if A *blocks* on B, B uses ConfigureAwait(false), C uses ConfigureAwait(false), and D uses the default (ConfigureAwait(true)), then you'll still deadlock.\r\n\r\nA lot of people think they can just use ConfigureAwait(false) in B and that \"transitively\" applies across their call tree, and they can block with impunity. But D has already captured its context by the time the ConfigureAwait(false) is run in B, so they still end up with a deadlock.\r\n\r\nThat's what I was trying to say.\r\n\r\n(Sorry about the delayed reply; Disqus has been sending a lot of comments to spam and I just noticed today)","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"4dbaaae2-a781-39c3-b6d1-5cb244da1a3b","date":"2017-10-04T16:15:14Z","timestamp":1507133714,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
