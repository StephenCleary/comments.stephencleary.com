It's entirely possible that by running in the debugger and stopping at breakpoints, you're slowing down the application sufficiently that the operations *appear* serialized.\r\n\r\nawait will immediately return - of course it will, that's the entire *point* of await. It sounds like you may be missing an await in your calling code. Every task returned by any methods in your code should be awaited at some point - if you find one that's not, then that's probably your problem. (A good first step is to turn on warnings as errors, since the compiler does its best to ensure you always await your tasks. It's not perfect, but it'll catch a lot of them).","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"0ca47572-0d99-34e5-a51a-940a4dd4a88f","date":"2016-06-26T21:03:50Z","timestamp":1466975030}
