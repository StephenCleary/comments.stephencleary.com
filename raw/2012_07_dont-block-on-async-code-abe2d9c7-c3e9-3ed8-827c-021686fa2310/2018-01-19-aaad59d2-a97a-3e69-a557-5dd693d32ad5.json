While it was one possible use case, it was considered a minor and obscure usage. Task at that time (.NET 4.0) was mainly intended for use with the Task Parallel Library, and it almost always represented a small amount of CPU-bound work. When async/await were introduced, they decided to flesh out the existing Task type and use it instead of creating a new Promise type.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Task has a bunch of members that should never be used when writing asynchronous code.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"80602b6f-3bd4-3070-a0bc-591ab42e6ae8","date":"2018-01-19T01:14:54Z","timestamp":1516324494,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
