E.g., Windows Phone heavily caches HTTP requests, so those can complete synchronously even if you don't expect them to. And if the task is already completed by the time it's awaited, then no asynchrony occurs, and no context is captured and used to resume.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"a2d2af39-3b11-3f4d-b0c9-e873510cb9bc","date":"2017-05-25T03:28:52Z","timestamp":1495682932}
