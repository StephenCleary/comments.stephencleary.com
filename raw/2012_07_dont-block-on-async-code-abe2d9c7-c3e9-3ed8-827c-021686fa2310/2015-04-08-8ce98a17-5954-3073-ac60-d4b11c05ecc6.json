I would recommend it in general, but I don't lose sleep if I forget it (which happens)!\r\n\r\nIf you are blocking, though, then yes, you need to have ConfigureAwait(false) everywhere. Note that this causes a maintenance burden; it's usually better to just sit down and convert the code to use async all the way.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"4161be7d-9ed3-3231-b9cb-fe50681e2259","date":"2015-04-08T11:49:49Z","timestamp":1428493789}
