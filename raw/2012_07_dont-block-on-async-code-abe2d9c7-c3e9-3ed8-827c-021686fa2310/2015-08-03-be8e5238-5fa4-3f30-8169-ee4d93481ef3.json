Since you're blocking the thread anyway, blocking on asynchronous code would just add overhead. (It wouldn't add a thread, since asynchronous service calls don't use a thread, but it would add other overhead). It would make more sense to just call the service synchronously. Or lean on sitefinity to support asynchronous actions. :)","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"7fff1e25-7d76-3a1d-bea9-5fc6ac70e338","date":"2015-08-03T14:08:01Z","timestamp":1438610881}
