Let's say the service reference method takes a really long time to complete; am I not still blocking the thread from being \"released\" while it awaits the result? Configuring the await to false prevents a deadlock, but I don't get what resources I would be saving or freeing up. In fact, it seems all I am doing is incurring cost by creating another thread:\r\n\r\nHere's 2 simplified examples of the sort of thing I am curious about:\r\n\r\n[https://gist.github.com/MerrittMelker/84d824a33d60288bcc07](https://gist.github.com/MerrittMelker/84d824a33d60288bcc07)\r\n\r\nMy last post got marked as spam because I kept playing with pre and code tags :(","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2015-08-02T02:25:27Z","timestamp":1438482327}
