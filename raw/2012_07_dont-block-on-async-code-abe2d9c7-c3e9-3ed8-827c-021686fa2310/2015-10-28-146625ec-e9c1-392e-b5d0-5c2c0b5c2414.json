It wasn't easy for me to figure out. Using await instead of .Result didn't stop the deadlock, for me.\r\n\r\nIt was FAR easier for me to learn how to create a thread and start it years ago when I was just starting as a developer than it was today to attempt to learn this daft deadlock-by-design approach MS used.\r\n\r\nHonestly, async and await, to me, at this moment, look like nothing less than the stretch marks of a language that is trying to do too much at once. Bloat.\r\n\r\nIf I need something to work asynchronously, I'll create a thread that does what I want and call a method from it when it is done. That is SO MUCH EASIER than debugging a freaking deadlock that is designed in to await and async.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that I am not criticising you. Your blog post is the only one that pointed me in the right direction. For that, I thank you.\r\n\r\nI am just kind of done with C# now. I loved C# yesterday. I loved C# 5 years ago. Even 15 years ago when it was a virtual clone of Java.\r\n\r\nYour post got me through today. It won't get me through tomorrow. Time to find a healthier language. For SharePoint work, it will be hard. I'll miss linq dearly. But I am not futzing around with async and await ever again.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"c1fae95f-05d9-300d-944d-240b3cbd22c9","date":"2015-10-28T03:03:39Z","timestamp":1446001419,"authorUserId":"disqus:naikrovek"}
