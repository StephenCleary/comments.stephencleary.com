I just tried your WinForms example and see exactly what you're talking about - looks like it will hang forever without ever returning. I doubt there's anything we could do at compile-time, but at runtime, is there a global \"deadlock detection\" concept or anything that would help troubleshoot something like this? Like in SQL Server where it will eventually kill off one of the connections that's involved in a deadlock.  \r\n\r\nOf course if we build things properly, deadlocks won't happen, but I can see this potentially being a common mistake.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2013-12-02T22:43:20Z","timestamp":1386024200,"authorUserId":""}
