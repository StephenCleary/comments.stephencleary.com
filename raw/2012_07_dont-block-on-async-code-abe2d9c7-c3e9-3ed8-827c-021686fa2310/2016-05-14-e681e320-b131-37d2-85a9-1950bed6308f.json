And I can do all this without needing to use ConfigureAwait(false) and also without triggering a Deadlock.\r\n\r\nHave I got that right?","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2016-05-14T09:42:01Z","timestamp":1463218921,"authorUserId":"disqus:Brondahl"}
