Alternatively, Joe Duffy has a blog post on deadlock detection but you need to provide your own SynchronizationContext (in this case, it would need to be a wrapper for the WinFormsSynchronizationContext): [http://joeduffyblog.com/2008/02/27/hooking-clr-blocking-calls-with-synchronizationcontext/](http://joeduffyblog.com/2008/02/27/hooking-clr-blocking-calls-with-synchronizationcontext/)  \r\n\r\nEither way, it would be quite a lot of effort. I think it's not worth it; in most cases, if a deadlock happens, it *always* happens. So we're not dealing with a deadlock caused by a race condition; this is usually just a one-time learning experience, not a dormant bug kind of problem.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2013-12-03T06:50:45Z","timestamp":1386053445}
