When running on the thread pool, there is no context to capture, and so ConfigureAwait(false) would be a noop.\r\n\r\nThis would be a good first step, reducing one-thread-per-request to one-thread-for-all-requests. The next step would be to replace WaitAll with await-WhenAll and remove the Task.Run's completely; this would give you zero-threads-for-all-requests (fully asynchronous).","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"e681e320-b131-37d2-85a9-1950bed6308f","date":"2016-05-14T12:56:11Z","timestamp":1463230571}
