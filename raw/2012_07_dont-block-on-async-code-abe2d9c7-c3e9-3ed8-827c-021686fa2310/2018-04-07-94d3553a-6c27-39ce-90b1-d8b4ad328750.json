In fact, I recommend that you use ConfigureAwait(false) whenever possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do *not* recommend blocking on asynchronous code, and thinking you can just \"make the deadlock go away\" by abusing ConfigureAwait(false). This is due to two reasons:  \r\n1) All of your \"asynchronous\" code that is blocked on must be aware that it is blocked on, and ensure that it uses ConfigureAwait(false) everywhere. \"All\" means the full transitive closure of all methods. It's extremely easy to miss one, and then you've got a deadlock - or even a deadlock that only sometimes happens. This is a maintenance nightmare.  \r\n2) Third-party code may or may not use ConfigureAwait(false). Or it may work in one version and then stop working in the next. Or it may work on one platform and not another (this actually happened with HttpClient).\r\n\r\nIt's far better to go async all the way. You end up with better design and more maintainable code.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"3bca749b-2343-3caf-b6bb-b90d414788fc","date":"2018-04-07T00:21:59Z","timestamp":1523060519,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
