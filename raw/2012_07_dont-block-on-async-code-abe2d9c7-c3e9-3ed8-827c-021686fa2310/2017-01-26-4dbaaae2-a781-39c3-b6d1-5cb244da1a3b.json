As a result, only B will resume on the very original context, while both A and C will not.   \r\nWhat exact problem do you see in this scenario? is it not how you would expect it to work? it completely meets my intuitive expectations. Every method makes its own decision whether it needs a context or not.  \r\nYes, by default you will get the same context, but who cares? defaults are just a question of taste. Every method in the call stack still has its own right to choose, regardless of all the other methods before or after on the same call stack.  \r\nI hope you see my point.\r\n\r\nHowever, I must say that if default was false, that would make things simpler, only when combining it with Task. Everything else about ConfigureAwait works just fine. It's just annoying that the default behavior creates the deadlock, so you'd need to explicitly opt out in the library code. That part I agree. I guess Microsoft didn't consider this combination scenario very well.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"ff5f686b-c6cf-3c0a-af10-197889527b8a","date":"2017-01-26T02:46:18Z","timestamp":1485398778,"authorUserId":"disqus:tengiztutisani"}
