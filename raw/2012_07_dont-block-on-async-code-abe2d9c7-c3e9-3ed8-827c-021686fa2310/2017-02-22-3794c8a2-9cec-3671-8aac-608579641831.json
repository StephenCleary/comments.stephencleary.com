It won't start out in one context and then jump to a threadpool context when it hits an await.\r\n\r\nPractically, a demo that just uses \"await\" has more wow power than a demo that uses \"await\" with \"ConfigureAwait(true)\". The ConfigureAwait would distract from the demo.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"7f650343-3f96-3a36-9b22-93a99d5669f9","date":"2017-02-22T17:53:48Z","timestamp":1487786028}
