You can just as easily keep it async and use await. Just use try/catch exactly like you normally would and use await to call your asynchronous APIs, and it will all work fine.\r\n\r\n> in practice how can a dev tell when he's dealing with a \"plagued\" async method like \"GetStringAsync()\" that can cause the dreaded deadlocks?\r\n\r\nThere is no way to know, short of inspecting the actual source code. This is one reason why I do not recommend depending on code not to deadlock. OK, it works today, but what about in the next version? Or on a different platform (HttpClient is an interesting use case where it never deadlocks on desktop but it can on Windows Phone)? Or in a different scenario (e.g., cached responses returned synchronously can cause the code to take a different execution path)?\r\n\r\nIt's far better to avoid doing sync-over-async in the first place. That way you have code that will always work.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"2ec2bd25-6238-35df-9e9f-dcfda1b58f6a","date":"2017-10-18T01:29:32Z","timestamp":1508290172,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
