But i have this one scenario, am not sure if the cause is mixing Async and Sync codes, or running on different threads. This is my problem.\r\n\r\nI have a callback function which runs very ok while on the UI. This callback calls methods which are implemented Asynchronously. I decided to migrate the callback to different class, i made a dll of the class and used the dll in my project.\r\n\r\nMy Problem.\r\n\r\nI have several methods which are in the same class as the callback and which depends on the variables from the callback function, when i call the first method i get the expected results. Calling the rest of the methods gives me wrong results. Will you please explain this scenario and advice me further. Kindly use my Email nyagenox@gmail.com\r\n\r\nThank you. @stephen_cleary:disqus","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2017-10-31T13:28:51Z","timestamp":1509456531}
