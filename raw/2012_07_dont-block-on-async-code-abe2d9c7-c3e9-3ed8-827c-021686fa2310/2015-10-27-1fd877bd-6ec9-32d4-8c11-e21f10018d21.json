Couldn't you show what changed between the methods before and after? I'm so run down from trying to chase this stupid problem that I had to copy/paste the before & after into a text file to see the difference. Why is teaching this topic so hard for people? NO ONE can do it effectively. Microsoft's own example on this ridiculous crap blocks when run from a UI! [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh191443.aspx#Anchor_1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh191443.aspx#Anchor_1) That is some absolutely stupid API design. To avoid this in the future I have written an HttpClient library of my own, with with raw sockets, because that was an easier problem to solve than this stupid deadlock-by-design API, and no, I'm not joking.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2015-10-27T19:26:08Z","timestamp":1445973968}
