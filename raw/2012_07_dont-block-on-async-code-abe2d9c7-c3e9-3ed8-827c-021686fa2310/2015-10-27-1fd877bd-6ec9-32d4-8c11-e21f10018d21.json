Couldn't you show what changed between the methods before and after? I'm so run down from trying to chase this stupid problem that I had to copy/paste the before & after into a text file to see the difference. Why is teaching this topic so hard for people?

To avoid this in the future I have written an HttpClient library of my own, with with raw sockets, because that was an easier problem to solve than this stupid deadlock-by-design API, and no, I'm not joking.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2015-10-27T19:26:08Z","timestamp":1445973968,"authorUserId":"disqus:naikrovek"}
