Dropped on this 2 yr old post in my almost Quixotic quest to see if I can do async in WebPages. Got it to work based on this post - though the \"use both\" is a mystery still...\r\n\r\nI'm getting away with it via ConfigureAwait on the top level request and if there are other async calls that's where \"async all the way\" occurs. Is this what you meant by \"use both\"?. Seems to work...\r\n\r\nThanks for posting this - am realizing how much I don't know about (yes, late bloomer). Hopefully your book will change this (just got it).
