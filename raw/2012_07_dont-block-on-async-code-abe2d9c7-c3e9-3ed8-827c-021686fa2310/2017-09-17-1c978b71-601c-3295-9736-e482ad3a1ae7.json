I go into more detail in these videos:  \r\n[https://vimeo.com/ondemand/asynctime/229418352](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/asynctime/229418352)  \r\n[https://vimeo.com/ondemand/asynctime/231644901](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/asynctime/231644901)\r\n\r\nAlso, EAP doesn't solve the core problem anyway: when developers choose to block on an asynchronous operation, the delegates still need to run on the UI thread, and blocking the UI thread will prevent that.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"864f7182-0020-3f04-b548-f8d700cd8d1f","date":"2017-09-17T01:11:56Z","timestamp":1505610716}
