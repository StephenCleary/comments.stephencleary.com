Your post makes a complex topic crystal clear. I am noticing usage of .Result in my codebase at work in ASP.NET controllers that are not marked async. Yet the logs don't reveal widespread ASP.NET timeouts - there are a handful, but according to your post, every request should be deadlocking. Are there circumstances under which using .Result in an MVC controller action would not result in a deadlock (ConfigureAwait is not used in these cases).","date":"2021-10-22T01:40:35.997Z"}
