Deadlocks do not happen in single threaded applications.\r\n\r\nYou and I will have to politely disagree on this, I guess. I shouldn't have to modify calling or called methods in order to prevent a deadlock. It is completely unreasonable.\r\n\r\nThe requirement that I use the async keyword all the way up and down falls well short of the encapsulation that an OO language like C# is supposed to provide.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"5b7a240a-5388-315e-a1c1-6fe767cf531d","date":"2015-10-29T16:24:31Z","timestamp":1446135871,"authorUserId":"disqus:naikrovek"}
