Changing the call to use HttpWebRequest to synchronously within the Service resolves the issue.\r\n\r\nJust to note, this was not using async all the way down (a lot of codebase to change for that) but was still occurring whilst using the first solution presented in this article. It also only seems to crop up for concurrent requests, and it happens when there are as low as 10 concurrent requests.","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"c09e7fb4-6444-3378-a975-c1126416fd86","date":"2015-03-19T09:38:42Z","timestamp":1426757922,"authorUserId":""}
