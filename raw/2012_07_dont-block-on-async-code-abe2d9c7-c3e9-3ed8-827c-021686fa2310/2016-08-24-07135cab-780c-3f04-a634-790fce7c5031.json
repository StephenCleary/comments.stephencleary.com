I think I'm getting there, but I have a question about handling mixed code. I believe this example illustrates it - ideally the database access would also be async but right now is not. Is this code okay for a console or ASP.NET app? Is it helpful, or should I just use synchronous HTTP access? It's async all the way (no Result or Wait), but potentially doing a lot of work in an async method. Is it bad to have any blocking io in an async method?\r\n\r\n``","postId":"2012_07_dont-block-on-async-code-abe2d9c7-c3e9-3ed8-827c-021686fa2310","replyTo":"","date":"2016-08-24T16:34:47Z","timestamp":1472056487,"authorUserId":"disqus:7yhnmju8"}
