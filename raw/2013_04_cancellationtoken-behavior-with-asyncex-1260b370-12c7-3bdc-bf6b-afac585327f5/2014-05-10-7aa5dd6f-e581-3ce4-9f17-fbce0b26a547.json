I would say use AsyncSemaphore (or AsyncLock) if you're already using AsyncEx or if the asynchronous methods on SemaphoreSlim are not available on your platform (check out the MSDN links in this post to see which platforms they support).  \r\n\r\nIn situations where you have SemaphoreSlim available (and you're not already using AsyncEx), then I would use SemaphoreSlim. SemaphoreSlim has slightly more awkward usage because you have to use a finally block instead of using, but it's not hard to write a disposable type that cleans that up.","postId":"2013_04_cancellationtoken-behavior-with-asyncex-1260b370-12c7-3bdc-bf6b-afac585327f5","replyTo":"","date":"2014-05-10T00:45:54Z","timestamp":1399682754,"authorUserId":""}
