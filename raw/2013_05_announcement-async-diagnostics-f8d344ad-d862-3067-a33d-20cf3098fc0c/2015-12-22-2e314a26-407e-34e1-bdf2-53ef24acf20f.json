It adds overhead to every method entry, exit, and await point. It's not a lot of overhead, but it's there. Also, I'm very familiar with async code so dealing with the truncated stacks isn't such a huge deal for me. And also post-build IL modification by third parties makes me nervous. :)","postId":"2013_05_announcement-async-diagnostics-f8d344ad-d862-3067-a33d-20cf3098fc0c","replyTo":"0a4510f8-32b3-3823-bec4-d48cc93a2a81","date":"2015-12-22T20:46:01Z","timestamp":1450817161,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
