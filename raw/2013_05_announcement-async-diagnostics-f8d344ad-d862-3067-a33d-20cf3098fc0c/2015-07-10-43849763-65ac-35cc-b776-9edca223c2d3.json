I did notice (before all this) that it asked if I wanted a trial run, to which I said yes, so I have 44 days left on that. I can only hope it will default over to the express version at the end of those 44 days... Looking forward to making good use of this tool to help me comb through this tangled mess. Thanks for the help.","postId":"2013_05_announcement-async-diagnostics-f8d344ad-d862-3067-a33d-20cf3098fc0c","replyTo":"c04c457c-fc26-3f2d-90d1-47216aa5e076","date":"2015-07-10T16:52:54Z","timestamp":1436547174,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_0eykuuQLuR"}
