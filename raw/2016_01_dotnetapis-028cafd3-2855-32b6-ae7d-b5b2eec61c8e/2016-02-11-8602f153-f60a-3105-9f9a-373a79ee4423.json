In particular, I assume that site visitors will be using a modern browser with JS enabled. Or at the very least, know how to enable JS themselves. :)\r\n\r\nIsomorphism is a possibility, but it would be some time before it would happen. There's a *lot* in the backlog! Iso is one of those \"nice to haves\" that - for this site - would mainly be about reducing the initial load time. And the initial load time isn't *too* bad at the moment, so iso is a pretty low priority.\r\n\r\nI am using a .NET backend; iso is still possible by hosting Node. This kind of approach looks promising: [https://github.com/aspnet/N...](https://github.com/aspnet/NodeServices \"https://github.com/aspnet/NodeServices\") But I'd estimate it's over a year out from a stable v1 release.","postId":"2016_01_dotnetapis-028cafd3-2855-32b6-ae7d-b5b2eec61c8e","replyTo":"a8bba25f-a7e5-3f81-9f49-4a9d62c36bcf","date":"2016-02-11T17:59:29Z","timestamp":1455213569,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
