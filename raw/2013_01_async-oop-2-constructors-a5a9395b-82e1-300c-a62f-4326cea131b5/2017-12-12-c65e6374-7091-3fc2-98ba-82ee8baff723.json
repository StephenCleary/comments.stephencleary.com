ASP.NET does not support asynchronous startup (and it looks like they're not going to). So blocking during startup is normal. I would not use Wait(); I'd use a synchronous Open() method if there is one, and use GetAwaiter().GetResult() if not.","postId":"2013_01_async-oop-2-constructors-a5a9395b-82e1-300c-a62f-4326cea131b5","replyTo":"c9dad251-e667-34f1-bd92-4668628f3994","date":"2017-12-12T13:55:21Z","timestamp":1513086921}
