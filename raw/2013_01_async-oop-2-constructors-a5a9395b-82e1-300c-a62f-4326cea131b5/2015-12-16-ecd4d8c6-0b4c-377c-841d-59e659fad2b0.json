The cleanest solution is probably to write an async-compatible wrapper for receiving a CustomerModel. You can do this by using TaskCompletionSource<customermodel> and calling TrySetResult when the CustomerModel arrives. Then you can await the Task property of that TaskCompletionSource<customermodel> in your asynchronous initialization method.\r\n\r\nLogically, what you're doing is first creating an async-compatible wrapper around the message listener, and then consuming that with regular async/await. It's probably best to factor the async-compatible wrapper into a parent or utility class.","postId":"2013_01_async-oop-2-constructors-a5a9395b-82e1-300c-a62f-4326cea131b5","replyTo":"1ece7bc1-f849-3880-a2b3-0f2e5cea95b5","date":"2015-12-16T03:00:08Z","timestamp":1450234808}
