Small nit, I would declare `public Task Initialization` as readonly. People have a tendency to change task field instances (e.g. Initialization = `Task.Run(..)`), usually unaware of the possible subtle issues they might introduce (mainly due to memory barriers).\r\n\r\nConsequentially, the biggest problem with async factories IMHO is that the initialize method can't initialize readonly fields, so you have to forego compile-safe immutability. I suppose you could use a `Lazy<t>`/`AsyncLazy<t>` and just do `lazy.Value` in the `InitAsync` method to get the next best thing though .","postId":"2013_01_async-oop-2-constructors-a5a9395b-82e1-300c-a62f-4326cea131b5","replyTo":"","date":"2017-09-13T13:14:11Z","timestamp":1505308451,"authorUserId":"disqus:ohadschneider"}
