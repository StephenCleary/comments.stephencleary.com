I know what I am asking has been ask buy thousands of others. In wpf viewmodel run  a task to download data to bind to say a grid. The thread would not return till clear after the window is displayed. So where can a notification be handled that tells when the task is finished and so the task status can be determined and the grid can be populated if the task ran to completion. I am using PRISM so the view is navigated to so the constructor on the view model be called at least once. \r\nYou have any actual demos that do this. I see you comment all over the place but seem to ever leave demo source code to download. If I do not see demo source available I just leave. Most of the comment and stuff published by people is just copy and paste","date":"2021-10-21T19:08:11.905Z"}
