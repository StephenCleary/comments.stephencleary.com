And of course the StockService code doesn't control its context, so it's not a great solution in that regard anyway.","postId":"2013_01_async-oop-2-constructors-a5a9395b-82e1-300c-a62f-4326cea131b5","replyTo":"07f589ac-968c-3641-9c1d-6d3fa4b1a71b","date":"2015-05-06T19:28:35Z","timestamp":1430940515,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
