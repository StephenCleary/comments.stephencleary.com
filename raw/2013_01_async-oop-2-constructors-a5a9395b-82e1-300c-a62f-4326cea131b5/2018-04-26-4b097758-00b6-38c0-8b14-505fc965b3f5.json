It doesn't make sense for them to be. When the platform says \"OK, show your UI\", your app can't say \"OK\" and then go off to some database or web service before it even returns the UI object to show.\r\n\r\nInstead, you must structure your app so that it shows a UI *immediately* (meaning *synchronously*). This UI can just be a \"Loading...\" screen or spinner or something, but you do have to construct and return the UI immediately. And in this mindset, the ViewModel is just the programmatic part of the UI - it also has to be constructed and returned immediately.\r\n\r\nYou can *start* asynchronous work in your ViewModel's constructor that will then update the ViewModel when it completes.
