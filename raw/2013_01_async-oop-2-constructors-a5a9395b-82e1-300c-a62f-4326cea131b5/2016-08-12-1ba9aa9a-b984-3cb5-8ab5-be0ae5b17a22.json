It doesn't work that well though: For some reason, the message itself is sent to the UI but the list view doesn't scroll up automatically in order to show the new item.\r\n\r\nI have then tried to use 'RunOnUiThread' instead of 'Task.Run' (see [http://pastebin.com/VgakKcy4)](http://pastebin.com/VgakKcy4) \"http://pastebin.com/VgakKcy4)\"), which is recommended when doing some work which then affects the UI in some way, and it works!\r\n\r\nI kinda understand why it works this way, but at the same time I really don't. In short, I am calling an async method, which doesn't run on the UI thread at all, inside a 'RunOnUiThread'? Isn't this paradoxical?\r\n\r\nThanks again!","postId":"2013_01_async-oop-2-constructors-a5a9395b-82e1-300c-a62f-4326cea131b5","replyTo":"1bc947b8-9310-3c48-a3fe-32cde07c668d","date":"2016-08-12T22:42:36Z","timestamp":1471041756,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_LfgagoSDen"}
