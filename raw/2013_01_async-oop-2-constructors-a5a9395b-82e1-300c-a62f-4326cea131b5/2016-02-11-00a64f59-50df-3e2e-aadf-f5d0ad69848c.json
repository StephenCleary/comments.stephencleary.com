What changes would the following require? [http://pastebin.com/PpzMDwAE](http://pastebin.com/PpzMDwAE \"http://pastebin.com/PpzMDwAE\")\r\n\r\nThere are some comments in the code to help you understand my questions. Also, when trying to retrieve the instance with 'MyClass.Instance()', I would still need an 'await', right? Which would imply another AsyncInitialization?\r\n\r\nThanks! :)\r\n\r\nEdit: while searching, found an anwer of yours at stackoverflow suggesting AsyncLazy. Would it be possible to avoid the 'await' when retrieving the instance? Perhaps by implementing a 'Result' inside AsyncLazy?","postId":"2013_01_async-oop-2-constructors-a5a9395b-82e1-300c-a62f-4326cea131b5","replyTo":"","date":"2016-02-11T00:29:07Z","timestamp":1455150547,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_IUwcFx2IkQ"}
