But I came accross a new problem where when the connection is disconnect and when it is connecting again the UI freezes.\r\n\r\nSo I have decided to read all your async contents again to make sure I fully understand the concept of asyncronous programming.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to follow the etiquette you confess about.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following approach would be suitable for my scenario?\r\n\r\nThank,","postId":"2013_01_async-oop-2-constructors-a5a9395b-82e1-300c-a62f-4326cea131b5","replyTo":"b37481e7-9057-3679-b4a5-fa305c3e569d","date":"2018-05-11T12:17:37Z","timestamp":1526041057,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_PPeujihbUV"}
