The async init pattern is only used when a factory pattern isn't feasible. You can use a public Task InitializeAsync() if you prefer, but that approach won't work well if multiple consumers attempt to initialize the object. That said, there are scenarios where that approach would be sufficient.","postId":"2013_01_async-oop-2-constructors-a5a9395b-82e1-300c-a62f-4326cea131b5","replyTo":"6125cf3f-f743-3bce-8977-19649ab8f72d","date":"2018-02-22T01:52:46Z","timestamp":1519264366}
