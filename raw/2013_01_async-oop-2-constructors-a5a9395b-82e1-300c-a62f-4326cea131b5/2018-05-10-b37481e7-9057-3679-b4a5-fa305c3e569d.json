So when the table is first used, it does a CreateIfNotExistsAsync. Other components using that table at the same time will just (asynchronously) wait for that initialization to complete. Once it's done, the table can be read/written at will; the initialization code is only done once for the entire AppDomain.","postId":"2013_01_async-oop-2-constructors-a5a9395b-82e1-300c-a62f-4326cea131b5","replyTo":"a4cc025e-a0bf-32a8-a485-cacaa764a28b","date":"2018-05-10T11:56:16Z","timestamp":1525953376}
