Since it's a Singleton class, it's expected to be accessible anywhere. Do I only need to 'await' InstanceAsync inside OnCreate? 'OnCreate' method works like the 'Main' from a console so it's the first method to get called. Or do I need to do it everytime? Or perhaps expose an 'Instance' method that just returns MyClass instance? Like so: [http://pastebin.com/gXfutUZm](http://pastebin.com/gXfutUZm \"http://pastebin.com/gXfutUZm\")\r\n\r\nIf exposing 'Instance' method is a valid option, shouldn't I check if 'Initialization' is null? And if so, would that be thread safe?\r\n\r\nThanks!","postId":"2013_01_async-oop-2-constructors-a5a9395b-82e1-300c-a62f-4326cea131b5","replyTo":"1bc947b8-9310-3c48-a3fe-32cde07c668d","date":"2016-02-12T01:43:43Z","timestamp":1455241423,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_IUwcFx2IkQ"}
