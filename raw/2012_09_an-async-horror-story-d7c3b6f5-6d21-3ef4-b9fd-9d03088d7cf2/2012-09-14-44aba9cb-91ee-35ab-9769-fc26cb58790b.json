C++ and JS have to use continuation passing style (at best), which is better than what I used for the project in this article (C++ with bare callbacks), but it's not nearly as good as async/await.  \r\n\r\nActually, I expect other languages to follow suit with similar systems (probably just dropping the context capturing and resuming). Python is almost already there with its Twisted library. I hope that a decade from now, every language will have some form of async/await.","postId":"2012_09_an-async-horror-story-d7c3b6f5-6d21-3ef4-b9fd-9d03088d7cf2","replyTo":"","date":"2012-09-14T04:02:09Z","timestamp":1347595329}
