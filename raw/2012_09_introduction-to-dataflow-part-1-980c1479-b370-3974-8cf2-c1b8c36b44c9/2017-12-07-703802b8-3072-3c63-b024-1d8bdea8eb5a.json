I/O-based operations are naturally asynchronous. This is not to say that the Parallel approach won't work - it will; it will just work by blocking extra threads. Inefficient but functional.\r\n\r\nRx doesn't support asynchronous subscriptions. Or more properly, it supports them as async void methods, so multiple data items can be processed concurrently. Rx is behaving as \"LINQ over events\" in this way, and the subscription is acting as an async void event handler. TPL Dataflow by default will provide a buffer so that asynchronous items are processed one at a time.","postId":"2012_09_introduction-to-dataflow-part-1-980c1479-b370-3974-8cf2-c1b8c36b44c9","replyTo":"d53cbe33-da4f-3a64-b2cb-096926d24a7f","date":"2017-12-07T21:38:39Z","timestamp":1512682719,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
