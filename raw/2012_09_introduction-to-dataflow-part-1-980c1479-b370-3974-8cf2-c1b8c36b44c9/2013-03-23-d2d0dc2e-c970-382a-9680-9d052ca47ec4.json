If the block doesn't want the data right then, Post will (immediately) return false. So I consider it \"synchronous\" from the point of view of the caller. It's \"asynchronous\" from the point of view of the mesh, because Post will just queue the item in the block's input buffer if possible.  \r\n\r\nSendAsync is asynchronous from both points of view: if necessary, it will (asynchronously) wait until the block is ready.  \r\n\r\nIn most situations, blocks don't restrict their input, so there's no difference between Post and SendAsync most of the time. A notable exception is when you set BoundedCapacity on the block options. A bounded block will attempt to postpone any incoming data if it's already full; this is where Post and SendAsync differ (Post returns false; SendAsync asynchronously waits for the block to have space available).","postId":"2012_09_introduction-to-dataflow-part-1-980c1479-b370-3974-8cf2-c1b8c36b44c9","replyTo":"","date":"2013-03-23T01:04:57Z","timestamp":1364000697}
