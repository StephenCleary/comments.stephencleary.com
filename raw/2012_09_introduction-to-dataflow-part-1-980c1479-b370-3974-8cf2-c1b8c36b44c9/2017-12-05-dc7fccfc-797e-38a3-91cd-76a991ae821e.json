TPL Dataflow permits the same kind of parallelism, and also supports asynchronous concurrency. If your Do1/Do2 are synchronous, then doing it with Parallel or doing it with TPL Dataflow is pretty much the same thing.\r\n\r\nRegarding ObserveOn, this is a way for Rx data to \"jump\" thread contexts, usually used in the middle of a query so that the first part of it is executed on a thread pool thread (e.g., throttling), and then after the ObserveOn the rest of the query is executed on a UI thread (e.g., updating UI elements). TPL Dataflow also permits \"jumping\" contexts in that each block has its own scheduler. In the TPL Dataflow world, while the scheduler *can* be used on an ActionBlock for UI updates, it is more commonly used with a ConcurrentExclusiveSchedulerPair to coordinate one or more TransformBlocks/ActionBlocks with each other.","postId":"2012_09_introduction-to-dataflow-part-1-980c1479-b370-3974-8cf2-c1b8c36b44c9","replyTo":"b6414c54-ad6f-39e7-8c63-ee84e298ee1c","date":"2017-12-05T20:10:48Z","timestamp":1512504648}
