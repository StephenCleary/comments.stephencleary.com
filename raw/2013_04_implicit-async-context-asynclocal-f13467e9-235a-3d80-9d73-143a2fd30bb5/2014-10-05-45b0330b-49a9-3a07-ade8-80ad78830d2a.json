The code works fine without one as long as all your code is in a single AppDomain - so if you Push and then further down your (logical) call stack make a cross-AppDomain call, the call would fail. What the wrapper provides is a proxy for the actual stack value so that the (logical) call stack can be accessed from other AppDomains.\r\n\r\nAt least, that's how I understand it. I do not have much experience with AppDomains at all.","postId":"2013_04_implicit-async-context-asynclocal-f13467e9-235a-3d80-9d73-143a2fd30bb5","replyTo":"64341ca5-5b3d-3afb-8806-b880350c3531","date":"2014-10-05T16:59:52Z","timestamp":1412528392}
