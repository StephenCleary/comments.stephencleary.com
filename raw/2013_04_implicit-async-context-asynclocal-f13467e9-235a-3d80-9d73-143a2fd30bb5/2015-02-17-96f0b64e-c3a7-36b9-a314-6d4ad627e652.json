It *can* be used as a diagnostic causation-stack, but it can just as easily be used to store other contextual data (i.e., a kind of application-specific HttpContext).\r\n\r\nHowever, I did look into LogicalOperationStack when you commented, and it turns out that it does (correctly) use the logical call context, but it (incorrectly) uses a mutable stack. So it will not operate correctly when your code uses asynchronous concurrency (i.e., Task.WhenAll).","postId":"2013_04_implicit-async-context-asynclocal-f13467e9-235a-3d80-9d73-143a2fd30bb5","replyTo":"51403dc2-c17a-3cd6-8d09-40199c253938","date":"2015-02-17T02:05:27Z","timestamp":1424138727}
