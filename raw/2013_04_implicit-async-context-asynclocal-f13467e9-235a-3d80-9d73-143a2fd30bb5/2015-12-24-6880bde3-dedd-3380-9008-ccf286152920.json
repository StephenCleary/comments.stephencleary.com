I have done some testing with your code (excellent article, Stephen, as always!) and it seems that the LogicalSet/GetData flows down to child tasks and not up or between sibling tasks. That is, if I comment out the line \"using (MyStack.Push(\"Main\"))\" the data works within each SomeWork task (\"1\" and \"2\") and their child tasks but not between them.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to pass data between sibling tasks and/or their parent tasks?","postId":"2013_04_implicit-async-context-asynclocal-f13467e9-235a-3d80-9d73-143a2fd30bb5","replyTo":"","date":"2015-12-24T22:53:41Z","timestamp":1450997621,"authorUserId":"disqus:Mike_EEE"}
