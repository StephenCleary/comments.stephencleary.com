By default it just attaches the causality stack to the Data property of any exception that is thrown, but it also allows using-style constructs to add your own data to the stack, and a Current property that allows you to read the current stack at any time.  \r\n\r\nNote that you'll need PostSharp 3.1 for OnEntry/OnExit to work correctly with async methods. I can't tell from your output whether it's actually getting mangled (the numbers and letters are the important parts). If you're already using 3.1 and you're sure the output is incorrect, it might be a problem with MethodExecutionTag (in which case you should notify PostSharp support).  \r\n\r\nSteve","postId":"2013_04_implicit-async-context-asynclocal-f13467e9-235a-3d80-9d73-143a2fd30bb5","replyTo":"","date":"2014-03-18T17:02:34Z","timestamp":1395162154,"authorUserId":""}
