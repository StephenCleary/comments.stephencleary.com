The output in my second reply is exactly how it looked on my unit tests. The numbers and letters are literally not there. So the MyStack.Push(string) method doesn't seem to be working in the PostSharp version I created. It worked perfectly in the version that uses using(){ } blocks however.  \r\n\r\nI see you use PostSharp in your AsyncDiagnostics library so I'll have to check it out to see what I'm doing wrong.  \r\n\r\nThanks for the original blog post and the reply!  \r\n\r\nPaul","postId":"2013_04_implicit-async-context-asynclocal-f13467e9-235a-3d80-9d73-143a2fd30bb5","replyTo":"","date":"2014-03-19T02:18:10Z","timestamp":1395195490,"authorUserId":""}
