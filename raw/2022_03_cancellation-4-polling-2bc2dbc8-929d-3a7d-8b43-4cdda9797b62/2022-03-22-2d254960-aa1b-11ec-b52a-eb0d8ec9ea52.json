It's *probably* wrong.\r\n\r\nThe tool is pointing out to you that there's probably a bug. So I see nothing wrong with disabling the warning; in fact, I *prefer* it, because `#pragma warning disable` or `// ReSharper disable once` is clearly recording right in the code \"I have read this warning, and I have determined that the code is correct in spite of the warning\". Writing clever (and possibly misleading) code just to silence a tool warning feels more wrong to me than explicitly silencing the warning.\r\n\r\nI haven't felt this way for long, though. I've come around to this point of view gradually just in the last few years.","date":"2022-03-22T20:03:44.288Z"}
