So in this case you are smarter than the analyzer and as with the \"!\"-(null-forgiving)-operator you can explicitly say \"I know better - this code is safe\" by suppressing the warning. So suppressing the warning here seems to be the right thing to do. I don't want to obfuscate code only to satisfy the analyzer.","date":"2022-03-22T04:18:32.571Z"}
