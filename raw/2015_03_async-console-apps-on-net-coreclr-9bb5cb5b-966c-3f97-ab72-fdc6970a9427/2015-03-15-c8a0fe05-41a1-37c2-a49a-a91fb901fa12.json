Besides having to Nuget a lot of packages, it went pretty well apart from one thing. CallContext...Do you know what the story is on this on the new platform(s)?. I figured if someone knew, it would have to be you:) For the sake of LightInject, CallContext is used to keep track of certain things across async points. Since CallContext and LogicalGetData/LogicalSetdata is sort of rooted in the Remoting namespace I would expect something a little more smooth in the CoreCLR.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nTurns out there is a AsyncLocal<t> class that serves the purpose of flowing data across async points. This is even available on .Net 4.5.([https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn906268%28v=vs.110%29.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn906268%28v=vs.110%29.aspx)) I would really like of you could shed some light on this. Is the AsyncLocal<t> on .net 4.5 just a wrapper around the CallContext and on the CoreCLR there is something else ? And does it have to represents immutable data like I know you have written about before?   \r\nBest regards   \r\nBernhard Richter","postId":"2015_03_async-console-apps-on-net-coreclr-9bb5cb5b-966c-3f97-ab72-fdc6970a9427","replyTo":"","date":"2015-03-15T08:08:27Z","timestamp":1426406907,"authorUserId":"disqus:bernhardrichter"}
