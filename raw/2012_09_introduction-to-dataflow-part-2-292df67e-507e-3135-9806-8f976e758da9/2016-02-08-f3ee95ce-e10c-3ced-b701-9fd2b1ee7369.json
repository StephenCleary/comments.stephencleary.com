Whenever I have a requirement that deals with time, the best solution is almost always Reactive Extensions (Rx). Rx is similar to TPL Dataflow but has all the primitives regarding time, like time-based throttling. Rx does plug nicely into TPL Dataflow so you can use Rx for the things it does well (throttling in a time window) and TPL Dataflow for things it does well (parallel processing).","postId":"2012_09_introduction-to-dataflow-part-2-292df67e-507e-3135-9806-8f976e758da9","replyTo":"b145c40e-9337-3940-a52d-e4384bb2ff06","date":"2016-02-08T14:07:07Z","timestamp":1454940427,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
