Note that blocks are shared between producer and consumer, so a single BufferBlock or ActionBlock would suffice (no need for a blocking collection). ActionBlock has built-in throttling, so you could easily specify your maximum. It's not that hard to add to a BufferBlock consumer (e.g., using SemaphoreSlim), but since it's already built-in to ActionBlock you may as well use that.","postId":"2012_09_introduction-to-dataflow-part-2-292df67e-507e-3135-9806-8f976e758da9","replyTo":"deff4432-1ebb-3d01-b86c-0a3a624b5a01","date":"2014-10-01T23:39:10Z","timestamp":1412206750,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
