There are 5.3e36 total unique random GUIDs, which is a lot. What is more important, however, is the likelihood of collision.\r\n\r\n>Assuming a perfect source of entropy on each device generating random GUIDs, there is a 50% chance of collision after 2.7e18 random GUIDs have been generated. That’s more than 2.7 million million million. That’s a lot.\r\n\r\nThere will be a 50% chance of a collision when you've generated (5.3e36) / 2 GUIDs,  Not 2.7e18 which is significantly smaller than half of the set of possible GUIDs.","date":"2020-02-06T19:30:51.696Z"}
