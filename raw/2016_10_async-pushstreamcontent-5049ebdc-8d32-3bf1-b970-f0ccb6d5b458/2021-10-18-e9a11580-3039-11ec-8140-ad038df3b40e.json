Since they're in `using` blocks, it would mean the `HttpResponseMessage` (and its content) would be disposed before returning them to ASP.NET. My first thought is that if you tried it, the call would fail because ASP.NET needs to use the `HttpResponseMessage` (and its content) to send the actual HTTP response. But it *might* work; I've never tried it.","date":"2021-10-18T17:36:23.444Z"}
