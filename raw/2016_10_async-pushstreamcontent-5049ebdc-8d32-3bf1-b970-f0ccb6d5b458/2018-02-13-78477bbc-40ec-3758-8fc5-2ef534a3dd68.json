This only happens when accessing through SSL + Firewall + Load Balancer. Localhost worked fine... The only way I was able to solve it was to return Transfer-Encoding: gzip to the client, set compression level on the ZipArchive to NoCompression and finally wrap the ZipArchive stream with a GzipStream. This way the downloaded ZIP file was not compressed but it fixed the transfer issues.","postId":"2016_10_async-pushstreamcontent-5049ebdc-8d32-3bf1-b970-f0ccb6d5b458","replyTo":"","date":"2018-02-13T15:07:55Z","timestamp":1518534475,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_DllHLq3XQH"}
