I've been doing some searching and nobody seems to mention this part, also can't find it on MSDN. It's clearly more than just a using statement, as I have no \"Resolve->using ...\" option. What reference do I need to include?  \r\n\r\nUsing .NET 4.5 if that helps (pretty sure this stuff didn't exist in 4.0 -- so maybe it doesn't help). ;-)  \r\n\r\n(p.s. -- sorry about that deleted comment above -- it was this one, but it was in the wrong place -- as a reply to svick instead of as a stand-alone comment -- hopefully, this one goes in the right place.)","postId":"2012_02_async-console-programs-2120b75e-4001-37ec-a5ad-04ca51ccb801","replyTo":"","date":"2013-05-12T02:51:36Z","timestamp":1368327096,"authorUserId":""}
