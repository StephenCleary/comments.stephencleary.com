They're working fine when run with AsyncContext as console apps, but aren't starting properly as Windows services.  \r\nI've looked at the AsyncContextThread class but can't figure out how I'm supposed to use it, sorry for being obtuse.  \r\nApologies if this is the wrong place to ask for clarification.","postId":"2012_02_async-console-programs-2120b75e-4001-37ec-a5ad-04ca51ccb801","replyTo":"2eb53275-b95c-3eef-916c-a157ebc7a2cd","date":"2016-10-04T11:50:58Z","timestamp":1475581858}
