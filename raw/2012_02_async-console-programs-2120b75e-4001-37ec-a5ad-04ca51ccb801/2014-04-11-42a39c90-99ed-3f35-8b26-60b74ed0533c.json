But it seems to double the number of threads.  \r\n\r\n[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23012279/no-of-thread-spikes-with-async-await-on-a-simple-custom-synchronization-contex](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23012279/no-of-thread-spikes-with-async-await-on-a-simple-custom-synchronization-contex)  \r\n\r\nIt'd be great if you could take a look into it when time permits. Thanks.   \r\n\r\nRegards,   \r\nPrasanna V.
