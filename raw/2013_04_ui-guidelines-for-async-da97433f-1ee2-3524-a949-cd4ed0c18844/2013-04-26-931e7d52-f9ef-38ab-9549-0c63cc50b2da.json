I know that in WPF 4.5 we can indirectly update the UI by making changes to data-bound objects, and even databound collections.  \r\n\r\nI assume something at some point gets marshaled to the UI thread, and this may be different depending on if INotify[...] is used or a DependencyProperty?  \r\n\r\nMy real question this is: when configuring an await, if the remaining tasks are just changing databound objects ... should I prefer ConfigureAwait(false) or no? Technically i don't need to resume on the UI thread due to the feature just described, but maybe I'd rather if the databinding will eventually lead to a thread swap or something anyway?  \r\n\r\nI may be wrong on a lot of my understanding, but thanks for any clarification here!","postId":"2013_04_ui-guidelines-for-async-da97433f-1ee2-3524-a949-cd4ed0c18844","replyTo":"","date":"2013-04-26T23:25:15Z","timestamp":1367018715,"authorUserId":""}
