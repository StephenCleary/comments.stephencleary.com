If you're already on a thread pool thread, then ConfigureAwait(false) would have no effect.\r\n\r\nGenerally, ConfigureAwait(false) is used in library code or code that is intended to be reused, where the code doesn't know whether it'll be run on a UI thread or not. If you have some internal method that is always called on a thread pool thread and you know it always will be, then you don't need ConfigureAwait(false). (Though some choose to do it anyway as a matter of coding style).","postId":"2013_04_ui-guidelines-for-async-da97433f-1ee2-3524-a949-cd4ed0c18844","replyTo":"61eee5ea-46b4-36a8-bf8c-bfdb214f5ab7","date":"2018-04-26T14:30:23Z","timestamp":1524753023}
