Lets take the collection example. A new method has to be added, say.. `removeIf(predicate)`. Then the maintainer adding this function has to at least find similar methods and mimic what they do (check if lock already held or something) and get that right. Just as many opportunities to mess up.","date":"2020-10-04T18:57:14.661Z"}
