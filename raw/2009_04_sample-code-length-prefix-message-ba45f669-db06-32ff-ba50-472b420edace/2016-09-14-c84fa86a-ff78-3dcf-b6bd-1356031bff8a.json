All the protocol/data for the IP Devices are in the Async class (modified/adapted from original Microsoft) so for connect to one device I just create an object of that class and the object does all....The question is...for many objects (to create many sockets and communicate with every device) of the same class will the system hang?...It's enough the async way (creating Tasks->async->await, ...async creating their own threads) for this case?.... in this scenario, what would mean \"a simple lock around a regular collection usually suffices\"?....sorry for my ignorance....Thanks!","postId":"2009_04_sample-code-length-prefix-message-ba45f669-db06-32ff-ba50-472b420edace","replyTo":"1463577d-c775-3f19-81a6-68579e092003","date":"2016-09-14T16:54:15Z","timestamp":1473872055,"authorUserId":"disqus:jesus_conejo"}
