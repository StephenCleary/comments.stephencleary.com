Thanks for clarify so many things. I'm using AsynchronousClient class from Microsoft for creating sockets and works pretty well when tested with some few devices (creating few sockets...creating Tasks, WaitAll, AsynClient objects ,etc), but I need to create many sockets (100-500) for send commands to IP Devices (these devices are the same and they have a protocol for connecting them and use them). Which could be the best way to do it?, in a concurrent way (I would prefer a concurrent way , not secuential) ? still with the same async way?, perhaps using ConcurrenBag for a better threadsafe?, which is your opinion?. Thank you!","postId":"2009_04_sample-code-length-prefix-message-ba45f669-db06-32ff-ba50-472b420edace","replyTo":"","date":"2016-09-14T14:55:18Z","timestamp":1473864918}
