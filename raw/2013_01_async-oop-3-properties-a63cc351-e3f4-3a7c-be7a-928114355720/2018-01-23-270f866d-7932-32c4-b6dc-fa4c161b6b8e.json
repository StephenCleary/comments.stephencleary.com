This should be fine as long as the async-method triggers a property changed event for whatever ui-related stuff is being done, and that any exceptions are picked up and propagated to the ui accordingly, right?  \r\nI still wish there was a cleaner solution for this.","postId":"2013_01_async-oop-3-properties-a63cc351-e3f4-3a7c-be7a-928114355720","replyTo":"","date":"2018-01-23T14:48:11Z","timestamp":1516718891,"authorUserId":"disqus:glen_olsen"}
