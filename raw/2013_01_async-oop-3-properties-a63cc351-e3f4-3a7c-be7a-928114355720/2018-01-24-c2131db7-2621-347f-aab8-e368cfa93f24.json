If you do want/need to retain the CB data-binding, then you could handle the property-changed event for the property it's bound to.\r\n\r\nIn either case, to kick off the async operation, you should call NotifyTask.Create. Note that the *starting* of an asynchronous operation is itself synchronous, so there should be no problem there.\r\n\r\nIf this doesn't answer your question, please post a Gist or a question on SO, send me the link, and I'll take a look.","postId":"2013_01_async-oop-3-properties-a63cc351-e3f4-3a7c-be7a-928114355720","replyTo":"270f866d-7932-32c4-b6dc-fa4c161b6b8e","date":"2018-01-24T15:26:06Z","timestamp":1516807566}
