Embedded devices, co-vendors, and existing protocols are the most common scenarios. It's safe to say we'll always have raw TCP sockets with us.\r\n\r\nI have a talk on TCP/IP protocol design that I submit to all kinds of tech conferences. Unfortunately, only one has ever accepted it. I think it is the best-attended talk I've ever had (after scaling for conference size(. Standing room only, people out in the hallway straining to hear. So I find it really curious that no other tech conference has ever accepted that talk. Well, I'm bad at writing abstracts, so that's probably why. Anyway, all that to say that even though I start that talk (and my SO answers) with some form of \"use SignalR/WebSockets if at all possible\", there are still lots of developers who still need to communicate over plain old TCP/IP for some inescapable reason or another.","date":"2019-06-17T02:16:58.402Z"}
