Though Im having one minor problem. I'm sending 10 small serialized objects from a server app to a client app (less than 100 bytes each). The Code works great when I step through it in debugger, but when I execute my program at 'full speed' it's not processing all of the objects. Any suggestions on how I can cure this?
