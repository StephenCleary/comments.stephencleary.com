Thanks for your Great blog and book! I learned many things about async and socket from your blog and book. I'm developing a multiplayer game in unity with c# and after a long time studying and developing i  have some issues that is important and i think i must ask an elite like you. <br>my question is about an appropriate way to end connection. there is 5 methods: 1)Shutdown 2)DisconnectAsync 3)Close 4)Dispose 5)Finalize. i use SocketAsyncEventArgs and codes must be non-blocking in a commercial software as i thought because you say \"(which you shouldn't be using in production code anyway)\" about blocking read. in my tests close is good and also other side get notified with receiving zero byte. and <i> don't need lingering and assuring to send last messages. </i><br><b>so in short is it appropriate to call only \"Close\" and discard Shutdown, DisconnectAsync, Dispose and Finalize?</b> primarily  Thank you for your share of knowledge. Best regards!","date":"2020-01-07T10:10:44.496Z"}
