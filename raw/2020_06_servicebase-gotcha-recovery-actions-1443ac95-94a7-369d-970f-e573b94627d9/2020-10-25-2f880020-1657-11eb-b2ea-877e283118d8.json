I also started programming around the same time as you, though I was mainly Basic back then - Apple IIe ROM Basic, then QuickBasic on DOS, and finally Visual Basic on Windows. Then I migrated to C++ for many years, and ended up being *forced* to learn C# because I couldn't find a job anymore doing C++. But it's all worked out for the best. :)","date":"2020-10-25T00:15:28.320Z"}
