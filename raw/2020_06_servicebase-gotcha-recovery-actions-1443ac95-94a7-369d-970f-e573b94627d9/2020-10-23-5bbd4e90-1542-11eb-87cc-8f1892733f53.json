I am a 45 old programmer. I started with Basic on the C64, tried some Pascal stuff on the Amiga 500, played a lot of PS2 games, learned the COBOL horror show (but never really used it - thank god), went into professional programming with VB 6.0 (it was reliable and REALLY fast, like C++ - compared to Vb.NET at that time) and since 10 years I rely on C#. Whenever I think of C# Async, I think of Stephen Cleary. At least to me, your name is like a brand in that regard. So...nothing else to say. Once again I am on your website. Keep up the good work. Cheers from Germany.","date":"2020-10-23T15:13:52.021Z"}
