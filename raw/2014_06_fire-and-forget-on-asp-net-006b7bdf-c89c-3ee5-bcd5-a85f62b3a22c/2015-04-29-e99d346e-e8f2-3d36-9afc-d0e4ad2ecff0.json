Will it be the same case as you mentioned :\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the ASP.NET runtime has no idea that you’ve queued this work, so it’s not aware that the background work even exists. For a variety of reasons, IIS/ASP.NET has to occasionally recycle your application. If you have background work running when this recycling takes place, that work will mysteriously disappear.\r\n\r\nWhat IF we send response back immidiately and continue processing with sending another request to Web API from within itself?\r\n\r\nPlease suggest.","postId":"2014_06_fire-and-forget-on-asp-net-006b7bdf-c89c-3ee5-bcd5-a85f62b3a22c","replyTo":"","date":"2015-04-29T07:52:08Z","timestamp":1430293928,"authorUserId":""}
