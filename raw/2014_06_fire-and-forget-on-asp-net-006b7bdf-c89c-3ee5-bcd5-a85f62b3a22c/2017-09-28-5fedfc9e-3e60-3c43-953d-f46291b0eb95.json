Thanks a ton for this.\r\n\r\nIn my project, there is need for fire & forget call from our webapi to other project webapi, and these above I have chosen the IRegisteredObject and I have used your nuget from [https://github.com/StephenCleary/AspNetBackgroundTasks](https://github.com/StephenCleary/AspNetBackgroundTasks) here.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I have chosen is,  \r\nto go with Queues, Hangfire or other distributed way, we need project level agreements as we are following SOA. we are the consumer, so the provider should be reading our message if we put into the queue. So this will take more time from business perspective.   \r\nAs of now I have chosen your nuget with IRegisteredObject as i also need error logging mechanism which may not be possible with solution 2 above.\r\n\r\nThe code perfectly works in our qualification environment. But when it goes into Pre-production environemnt which load balanced, there i can see the 401 unauthorized error. I do not know why?\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea in this regards,? this is very urgent.","postId":"2014_06_fire-and-forget-on-asp-net-006b7bdf-c89c-3ee5-bcd5-a85f62b3a22c","replyTo":"","date":"2017-09-28T13:56:36Z","timestamp":1506606996}
