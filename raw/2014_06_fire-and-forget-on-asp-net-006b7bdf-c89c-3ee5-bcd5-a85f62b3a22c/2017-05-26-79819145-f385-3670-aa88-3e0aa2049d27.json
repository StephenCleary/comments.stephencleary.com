I haven't heard of people using a WebAPI endpoint for the *backend* to hit, but there's no reason why it wouldn't work.\r\n\r\nIf your work is more permanent in nature as opposed to transient, then you can also consider polling. Polling has a bad rap, but it's appropriate for a lot of use cases and - depending on what your app does - can also scale much further than an actual bus. There are some big names in distributed computing that swear by polling.","postId":"2014_06_fire-and-forget-on-asp-net-006b7bdf-c89c-3ee5-bcd5-a85f62b3a22c","replyTo":"178c2a89-bebc-35f9-a24e-86b4ab3f6f3c","date":"2017-05-26T12:39:57Z","timestamp":1495802397,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
