So your slave process can receive requests, do the work, and send the response, all synchronously; and the master process can send requests and receive responses asynchronously.\r\n\r\nIt's the same as a standard client/server scenario (where the asynchrony of the client is independent of the asynchrony of the server), just in this case there's only one client and they're both on the same box.","postId":"2014_06_fire-and-forget-on-asp-net-006b7bdf-c89c-3ee5-bcd5-a85f62b3a22c","replyTo":"9374c12a-313d-392f-af7c-e9fceff89a3a","date":"2018-03-15T15:01:04Z","timestamp":1521126064}
