ActionBlock is a higher-level abstraction; as you noted, you can limit the threads with it. But if you encapsulate the call in a separate process, that's what I would recommend.","postId":"2014_06_fire-and-forget-on-asp-net-006b7bdf-c89c-3ee5-bcd5-a85f62b3a22c","replyTo":"1df10440-5e43-3ae3-914c-d4694f4093b7","date":"2018-03-05T21:23:57Z","timestamp":1520285037}
