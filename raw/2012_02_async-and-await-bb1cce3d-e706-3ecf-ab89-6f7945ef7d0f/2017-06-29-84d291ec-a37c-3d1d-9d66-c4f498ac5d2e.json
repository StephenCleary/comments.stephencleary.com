It is a way of informing the runtime that you don't need to resume on your context.\r\n\r\nThat said, the code after the configured await will resume on the thread pool IF the task passed to the await is not already complete. You can't really depend on that behavior, though; e.g., Windows Phone heavily caches HTTP requests, so DownloadFileContentsAsync may actually complete synchronously, causing the following code to execute on the context.\r\n\r\nIf you need to run code on a thread pool thread, use Task.Run; that's what it's there for. If you don't need to resume on your context, then use ConfigureAwait(false).","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"7472f1a9-dc40-3274-b89c-0547ce765209","date":"2017-06-29T17:27:21Z","timestamp":1498757241}
