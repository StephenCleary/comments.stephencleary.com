Your posts have enlightened me on the topic. I saw a lot of blocking async await code in our app by either Wait or Result keywords and when i pointed that this would hamper scalability by holding up the thread for IO calls, this was defended with statements like \"There are multiple boxes. So scalability is not a concern\"  \r\nThe app here is a web server that needs to entertain multiple requests.So I got the feeling that non blocking await on async methods were being treated like premature optimization kind of things and waiting (blocking the thread ) was fine as there were multiple boxes to help with scalability which in my opinion is incorrect as it does not squeeze enough juice from the boxes. Just wanted to get your opinion on the same","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"","date":"2017-02-02T10:28:39Z","timestamp":1486031319,"authorUserId":"disqus:chandangurjar"}
