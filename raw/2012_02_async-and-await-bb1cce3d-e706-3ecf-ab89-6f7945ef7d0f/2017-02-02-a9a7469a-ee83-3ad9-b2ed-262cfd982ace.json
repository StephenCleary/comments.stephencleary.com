Your posts have enlightened me on the topic. I saw a lot of blocking async await code in our app by either Wait or Result keywords and when i pointed that this would hamper scalability by holding up the thread for IO calls, this was defended with statements like \"There are multiple boxes. So scalability is not a concern\"  \r\nThe app here is a web server that needs to entertain multiple requests.So I got the feeling that non blocking await on async methods were being treated like premature optimization kind of things and waiting (blocking the thread ) was fine as there were multiple boxes to help with scalability which in my opinion is incorrect as it does not squeeze enough juice from the boxes.
