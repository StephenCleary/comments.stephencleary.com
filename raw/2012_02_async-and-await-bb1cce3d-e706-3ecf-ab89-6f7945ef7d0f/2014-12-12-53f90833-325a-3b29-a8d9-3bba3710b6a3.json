I want something that uses classes to do the searching ... instead of a BackgroundWorker this keeps bloat out of the ui and is testable. But I can't find ways to do something like Application.DoEvents so that the UI stays responsive. I also need to fire events back to the UI to update current search path and separately any anomalies found. I thought Task.Yield might but the documentation specifically says \" do not rely on await Task.Yield(); to keep a UI responsive.\"","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"","date":"2014-12-12T02:32:29Z","timestamp":1418351549}
