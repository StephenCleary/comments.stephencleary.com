I am just new to this world of asynchronous stuff. So had a few very basic question swirling in my head . Please bear with my lack of knowledge.   \r\n1) You have told \"It tells the awaitable to run the remainder of the method when it completes, and then returns from the async method.\" I did not get this part. So does it mean the method still keeps on running synchronously and waits till the awaitable returns and then proceeds with the rest of the method ?   \r\nIf not please explain then why [task.run](http://task.run \"task.run\") is needed to run a method in the background or in a fire and forget manner. I could still be achieved via await also right ? i.e. The method keeps on executing the rest of the statements without waiting for the await to return . I hope that is similar to a background run approach. Or is not it ? I am confused .\r\n\r\n2)If a method is marked with async and await and that in turn calls another method asynchronously in a separate layer that's also marked with async and await .. then how the the call of the first method that's marked with async and await from a separate method say name ABC should look like ? I do not want to annotate that method to be async/await. So\r\n\r\nTask.Run(() => DoWork()); from ABC () is fine without marking it async/await? Or is it against the principle of   \r\nof asynchrony ?  \r\nDoWork which is async/await needs to be called in the background in fire and forget approach .","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"","date":"2016-04-13T17:09:02Z","timestamp":1460567342,"authorUserId":""}
