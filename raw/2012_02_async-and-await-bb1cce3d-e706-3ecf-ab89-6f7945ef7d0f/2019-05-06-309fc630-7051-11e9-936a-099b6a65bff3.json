E.g., with DMA, the device can access the memory directly. There's no CPU involved, and thus no thread at all.\r\n\r\nTo *complete* the I/O work, some notification does need to come in. This kind of notification (eventually) usually ends up on a thread pool thread, which is what actually transitions the `Task` object to the completed state. This in turn queues up the continuation of the `Log` method.","date":"2019-05-06T22:49:22.746Z"}
