Just one more question to make sure I fully understand what you mean: I understood that whereas Task.Run()offloads the computation to a thread pool thread, ConfigureAwait(false) only says that the current context can be ignored and, as a consequence, the method can run on any available thread. In this respect the thread switch is not necessarily implied but could happen for \"internal optimisation\" purposes. Now, if there is no context to capture then such optimisation is not triggered and no thread switch would occur. Is this correct? thanks again","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"7f1af948-648d-3f77-a2fd-a157340b5b3f","date":"2017-04-25T08:50:36Z","timestamp":1493110236,"authorUserId":"disqus:giuliagualdi"}
