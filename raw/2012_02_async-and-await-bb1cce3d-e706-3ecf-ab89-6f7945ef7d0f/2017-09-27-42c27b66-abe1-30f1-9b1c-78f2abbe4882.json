You usually don't have to think about this.\r\n\r\n> some where up the chain you are probably in a non async situation.\r\n\r\nNo, probably not. Ideally, you wouldn't have sync-over-async. You do have to do it in some situations (e.g., Console apps and Win32 Services often do this), but in most modern applications you can go \"async all the way\" (e.g., ASP.NET, WebJobs, Azure Functions, WPF, WinForms, Xamarin, ...).","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"5c914afb-ae1d-3a60-b168-2c6eebbdff4b","date":"2017-09-27T13:37:39Z","timestamp":1506519459}
