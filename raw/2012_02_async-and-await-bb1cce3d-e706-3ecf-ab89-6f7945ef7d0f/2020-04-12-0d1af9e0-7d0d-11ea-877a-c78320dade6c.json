For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic MyActivity : AppCompatActivity\r\n{\r\n...\r\n...\r\n\r\nprotected override void OnResume()\r\n{\r\n\tbase.OnResume();\r\n\tawait InitModel();\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate async Task InitModel()\r\n{\r\n\tmModel = await mClient.GetModel(...);\r\n\tif (mModel == null)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t// Any UI operation\r\n\t\tmErrorText.Text = \"Error loading data.\";\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n...\r\n...\r\n...\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems this still works even though InitModel() is running on a worker thread. I read your answer to Ashutosh that is related, but I'm not sure whether this is good practise or whether I should be enclosing these UI operations in Activity.RunOnUIThread().","date":"2020-04-12T22:29:19.883Z"}
