So many thanks.  \r\nBut I feel I'm still missing something each time I read you suggesting to use ConfigureAwait(false) whenever it's possible.   \r\nYou say that the continuation don't resume on the original context and runs on the thread pool context. This is something I clearly understand when calling a CPU-bound operation asynchronously but not when operation is I/O-bound.  \r\nUnless I misunderstood your point in your article \"There is no thread\", how can the thread pool context be requested if no other threads except the UI thread are involved in the process? What will be the behavior of ConfigureAwait(false) in that case?","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"","date":"2015-02-26T19:20:28Z","timestamp":1424978428,"authorUserId":""}
