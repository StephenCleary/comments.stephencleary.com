It is only *started* on the UI thread.\r\n\r\nWhen the task completes, in most cases it is being completed on a thread pool thread. E.g., I/O completions and timer (Task.Delay) completions are run on a thread pool thread. Thus, it is ConfigureAwait(false) that allows the async method to just continue executing directly on the same thread as the task completion. Resuming on the UI context is what causes a context switch.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"b488870b-1449-32c9-b121-2abf12a94360","date":"2017-06-03T03:53:56Z","timestamp":1496462036}
