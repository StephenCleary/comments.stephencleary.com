Effectively, it still looks and acts like it \"blocked\"....even if the thread is spinning on a polling loop...  \r\n(Its that the definition of \"blocking\"? Its async because you can start the task at anytime in the method without awaiting by saving the task variable...but as soon as you call await on the task variable you enter blocking mode...assuming the calling thread hasn't completed.\r\n\r\nThe calling thread blocks on the \"await\" keyword until the task completes. Or if you don't like calling it \"blocked\" then the thread is \"suspended\" until it gets a wake up \"signal\" from the task to resume...\r\n\r\n]","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"","date":"2018-04-30T16:13:24Z","timestamp":1525104804,"authorUserId":""}
