It explains well why the use of ConfigureAwait(false) is interesting, whatever the asynchronous operation is CPU-bound or I/O-bound.  \r\nI now recall a comment from your article \"There is no thread\" which, along with your explanation above, leads me to understand the statement \"there is no thread\" as \"there is no thread being blocked while (pure/natural) asynchronous operation is running\". As you said, the completion notification is so brief that the thread requested cannot be considered as blocked.  \r\nIf we assume that continuations will be quick operations as well, the statement still stay true.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"9a9bec5d-4987-3e23-8552-ee0ccdc0d0c5","date":"2015-02-27T10:39:17Z","timestamp":1425033557,"authorUserId":""}
