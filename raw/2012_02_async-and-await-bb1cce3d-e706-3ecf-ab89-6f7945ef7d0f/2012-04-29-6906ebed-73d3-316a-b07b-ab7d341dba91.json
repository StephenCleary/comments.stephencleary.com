I have an actor based model in mind while your's is a functional programming model. I will have a deeper look at functional programming. So far I have no clue on how to model the 'reality' when I'm not allowed to change the models state. I actually could generate new versions of the model for every modification - but then I would have several threads working on different versions of the model - how this could work out is currently beyond my imagination...  \r\nThanks for the discussion.  \r\n/Stefan","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"","date":"2012-04-29T01:10:24Z","timestamp":1335661824,"authorUserId":""}
