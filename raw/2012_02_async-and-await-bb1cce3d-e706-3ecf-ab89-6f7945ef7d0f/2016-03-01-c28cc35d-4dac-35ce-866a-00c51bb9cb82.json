I've read so many articles and a bunch of books covering this topic, but the none made the lightbulb burn as brightly as it did in this one. You have a knack of distilling the essence of complex topics. So, please do write more.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I'm a bit hazy about is...when do you need to continue on the same context? Could someone point out a real world example? (i get the part where you don't need to use the same context to prevent deadlocks, so why isn't not continuing in a context given as a default by Microsoft?)","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"","date":"2016-03-01T07:12:33Z","timestamp":1456816353,"authorUserId":"disqus:vetiarvi"}
