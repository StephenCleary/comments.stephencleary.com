Using asynchronous code all the way would be more efficient, but if your company has the operating funds to be less-efficient, that's their call.\r\n\r\nSo, either synchronous or asynchronous code is OK, depending on the application's and company's situation.\r\n\r\nHowever, it sound to me like you have a mix of asynchronous and synchronous code, which is quite odd. This might make sense if it was only *temporarily* that way, while moving to asynchronous code. But a permanent mix is not a viable development strategy - it's probably just an oversight. I would treat it as technical debt, and make it synchronous or asynchronous eventually.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"a9a7469a-ee83-3ad9-b2ed-262cfd982ace","date":"2017-02-02T13:58:10Z","timestamp":1486043890,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
