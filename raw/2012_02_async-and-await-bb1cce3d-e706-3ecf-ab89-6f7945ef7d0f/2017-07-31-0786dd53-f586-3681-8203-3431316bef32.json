It sounds like an independent process would be best.\r\n\r\nI've worked with logs for often-disconnected systems, and have had good success with a simple approach of rollover logging (maximum size) combined with deleting old log files based on disk space (rather than time). I have some systems with years worth of logs just because large hard drives are cheap.\r\n\r\nI didn't sync to a central server, though. For that, I'd recommend an independent process, which can be running in the background inside your main process if you want.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"694b0655-05ce-3e2b-b18b-3dc3abe339f6","date":"2017-07-31T21:03:26Z","timestamp":1501535006,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
