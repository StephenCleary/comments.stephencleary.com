When an await instruction is suspended because the awaitable has not completed, there has to be something that monitors the completion of that task in the background, and when the awaitable completes, resume the await instruction. What is the mechanism that does this background activity? Are all pending awaits queued to some background thread for monitoring?\r\n\r\nThank you!","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"","date":"2017-07-11T23:52:50Z","timestamp":1499817170,"authorUserId":"disqus:dibyendumajumdar"}
