QUESTION 1: HOW COULD IT HAVE ALREADY COMPLETED, IF IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE ARE CALLING MOE()?\r\n\r\n           -- if “await” sees that the awaitable has not completed, then it acts asynchronously. It tells the awaitable to run the remainder of the method (DOES THE REMAINDER MEAN THE \"PART B\"??) when it completes, and then returns from the async method (DOES RETURNING FROM THE ASYNC METHOD MEAN THE RESULT OF AWAIT MOE()?)\".\r\nThank you.","date":"2018-10-21T17:26:24.785Z"}
