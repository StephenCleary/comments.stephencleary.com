Each method should decide for itself whether it needs the context, and should use ConfigureAwait(false) (or not) based on that. It doesn't matter whether methods further up or down the call stack do or don't; make the decision for each method individually.\r\n\r\nThat's the general rule.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you're using ConfigureAwait(false) to avoid deadlocks when you use the sync-over-async antipattern (which is certainly a situation I do *not* recommend), then you *have* to use ConfigureAwait(false) for every await, and every single method you call also *has* to use ConfigureAwait(false) for every await, and every method *they* call also *has* to use ConfigureAwait(false), etc., including library methods such as SomeLib.DownloadString. This is a difficult requirement to meet and maintain over time, which is why I don't recommend it.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"39e88d2c-d62f-3fb1-a865-8d195abd278e","date":"2016-05-03T11:58:24Z","timestamp":1462276704,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
