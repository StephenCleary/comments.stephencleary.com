I have a question about application of this. Right now we have an audit process that logs to a text file locally to avoid connection issues, and to avoid filling the harddrive we delete the files after 60 days. I'd like to setup an async method that just keeps trying to send these log files to a SQL server until it succeeds in the event of a connection failure but allows the auditor process that reports the error to continue to check for other errors while its sending the first error message back to the error repo. It may also find other errors and report more.\r\n\r\nWhat would you suggest is a good way to do this using this method?\r\n\r\nIs there a max limit of tasks that can execute asynchronously or would it be best to keep our old text file methods?","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"","date":"2017-07-31T17:19:04Z","timestamp":1501521544,"authorUserId":""}
