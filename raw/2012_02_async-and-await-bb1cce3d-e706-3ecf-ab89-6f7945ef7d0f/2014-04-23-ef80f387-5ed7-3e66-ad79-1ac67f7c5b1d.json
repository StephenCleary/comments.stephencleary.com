It's useful in a few scenarios, like if you look up the result in an in-memory cache, so there's no asynchronous work to do. Or if you have an asynchronous (Task-returning) method in an interface or base class and need to override it with a synchronous implementation, like a test stub.  \r\n\r\nIn production code, await is used a lot more often than Task.FromResult.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"","date":"2014-04-23T04:30:59Z","timestamp":1398227459}
