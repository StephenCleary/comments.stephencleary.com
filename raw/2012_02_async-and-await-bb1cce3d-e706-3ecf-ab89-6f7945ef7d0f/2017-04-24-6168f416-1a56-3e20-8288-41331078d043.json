I am trying to get a deep understanding of asynchronous programming so I am reading lots and lots of articles (mainly yours!).. However, one thing that I am not sure about is whether the guideline of using Configure.Await(false) whenever possible holds also within a .net (core) web app context...as far as I understood from various readings, in this situation switching threads (i.e. offloading) could actually harm the overall scalability on the server side and should be avoided most (if not all) of the time. Furthermore, it seems to me that, within a web app context, it only makes sense to use asynchronous programming for I/O operations which, by definition, do not really need a thread. Is my understanding correct? thanks a lot in advance!","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"","date":"2017-04-24T13:21:02Z","timestamp":1493040062,"authorUserId":"disqus:giuliagualdi"}
