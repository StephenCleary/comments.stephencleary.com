Because sometimes this didn\u0027t work, e.g. when the outer function is a Constructor:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060cs\npublic Constructor()  // async doesn\u0027t work here\n{  \n  await Function1();\n}\npublic async Task Function1()\n{\n  await Function2(); // I would prefer to stop the async/await here\n  // use _globalVar here\n}\npublic async Task Function2()\n{\n  var _globalVar = await DownloadFileAsync();\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nHow can I do this? (perhaps with WaitAll/WhenAll?)\n\nThanks \u0026 regards Thomas\n\n","date":"2023-02-10T15:30:22.6216730Z"}
