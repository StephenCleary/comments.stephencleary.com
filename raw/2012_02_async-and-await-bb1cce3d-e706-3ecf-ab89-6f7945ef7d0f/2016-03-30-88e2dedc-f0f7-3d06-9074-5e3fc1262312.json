If you block at any point, you lose all the benefits of asynchrony in the first place.\r\n\r\nI generally recommend making a single \"vertical slice\" to be async all the way, avoiding any async-over-sync or sync-over-async antipatterns. But sometimes it can be useful to have both sync and async versions of the same method during a transition period; see my article on Async Brownfield development: [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt238404.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt238404.aspx)","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"17b4f153-f0d7-3823-9101-74dcb77c7de0","date":"2016-03-30T01:15:17Z","timestamp":1459300517}
