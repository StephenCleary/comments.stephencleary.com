This means that the method can resume executing anywhere - it doesn't care. Usually this means it will resume on a thread pool thread.\r\n\r\nYes, I recommend using ConfigureAwait(false) anytime you do not need the context. Business classes that do not use the UI are a prime example where ConfigureAwait(false) should be used.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"83aa3745-27fc-38a3-b814-38efc8f88723","date":"2015-11-11T13:15:43Z","timestamp":1447247743}
