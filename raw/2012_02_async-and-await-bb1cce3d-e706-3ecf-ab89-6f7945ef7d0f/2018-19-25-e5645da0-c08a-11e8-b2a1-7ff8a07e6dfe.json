I can't change the framework  (which is mainly a background item processor).\r\n\r\nNow, what are my options to call async method.  I see below options:\r\n1) Task.Run - Wouldn't this option result in spawning a new task for every operation?  I am concerned about wasting resources by creating new task/thread every time.\r\n2) ConfigureAWait all the way - I see mixed reviews of this one.. \r\n\r\nThe options are outlined in blog below:\r\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pfxteam/2012/03/24/should-i-expose-asynchronous-wrappers-for-synchronous-methods/\r\n\r\nI would like to learn what's the best practice for such cases as this seems a very common case..","date":"2018-09-25T06:19:02.560Z"}
