This causes DoSomethingAsync to return an incomplete task.  \r\n- TestAsyncCall stores that incomplete task into TaskResult1 and invokes DoSomething.  \r\n- DoSomething returns \"synch\" to TestAsyncCall.  \r\n- TestAsyncCall stores that string into Result2.  \r\n- TestAsyncCall awaits the task returned from DoSomethingAsync. This causes TestAsyncCall to return to its caller.\r\n\r\nsome time later...  \r\n- The task returned from Task.Delay completes.  \r\n- DoSomethingAsync resumes executing. It may be on the same thread or a different thread, depending on the context that was captured by its await (see my post on this page for details).  \r\n- DoSomethingAsync completes its task with the value \"asynch\".  \r\n- TestAsyncCall resumes executing. Again, it may or may not be on the same thread.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"a2335ec3-165b-32d9-82ad-a616eb4de913","date":"2017-06-26T13:53:14Z","timestamp":1498485194}
