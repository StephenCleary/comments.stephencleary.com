Another reason we'd like to move to a central SQL repository. In most cases the connection is good, but some locations are in the boonies and can be without internet services for days. Additionally the fact that we cannot track issues more than 60 days old gets annoying to find a history of errors as well. Some items only occur once or twice a year and we have no way to track the error frequency.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"0bb05938-a234-35ff-94e0-0882cd911de6","date":"2017-07-31T17:25:20Z","timestamp":1501521920,"authorUserId":""}
