It's easier to have a main form that is invisible.\r\n\r\nMost likely, what you're seeing is that the Progress<t> constructor is being called before the WinFormsSynchronizationContext is installed. This will cause problems, as the progress reports will not be sent to the UI thread.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"81f50e8e-1c8d-3b57-a668-6c25cb4be043","date":"2018-03-22T15:01:51Z","timestamp":1521730911}
