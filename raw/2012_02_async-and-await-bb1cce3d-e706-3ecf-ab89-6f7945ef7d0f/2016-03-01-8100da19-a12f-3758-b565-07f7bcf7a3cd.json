I do think it would be better if they didn't, but I have to admit that capturing the context by default does make for better demos.\r\n\r\nYou would need the same context if code later in that method needs it. A common example is UI objects in a client app: if the \"await\" is, say, retrieving some HTTP resource, and then later that method updates a label or textbox with those results, then that method would need its context because it's accessing UI objects. A less common example is on the server side, where an ASP.NET method has to write to the output stream or do some formatting in the user's current culture (which is part of the ASP.NET context).\r\n\r\nGenerally, you can avoid context capture until your code breaks, and then you know you need it. :)","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"c28cc35d-4dac-35ce-866a-00c51bb9cb82","date":"2016-03-01T13:04:13Z","timestamp":1456837453,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
