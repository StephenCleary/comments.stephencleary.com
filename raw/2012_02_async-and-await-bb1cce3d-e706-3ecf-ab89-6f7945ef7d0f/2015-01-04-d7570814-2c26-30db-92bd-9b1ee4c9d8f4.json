You can implement a workaround like Task.Run, but the ideal solution would be to augment the API so it supports asynchrony natively.\r\n\r\nRegarding return types, both await and Task.Run will work just fine with return values. E.g., if Execute() returns an int, then you can do \"int result = await Task.Run(() => objSlowOperation.Execute());\"\r\n\r\nIf any of this isn't clear, feel free to post a question on Stack Overflow. Source code examples in particular are formatted much nicer on that site than in my blog comments. :)","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"fac3e235-8c1d-3abc-af64-0e271c3d5d61","date":"2015-01-04T20:32:39Z","timestamp":1420403559,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
