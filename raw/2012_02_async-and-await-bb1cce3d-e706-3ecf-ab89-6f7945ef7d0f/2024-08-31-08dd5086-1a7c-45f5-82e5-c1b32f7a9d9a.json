But I cannot understand what are the benefits from all *Async methods called with await. If every *Async is called with await, then the real result is the same like synchronous equivalent and sync method is easier to predict what will happen. In many cases it is easier to do things synchronously and start new threads if something must be done in parallel. With thread and classic synchronization (mutex, semaphore, lock) the job will be done. What is the benefit? And is there something improved and made easier since Net 6 ?","date":"2024-08-31T16:41:03.6145925Z"}
