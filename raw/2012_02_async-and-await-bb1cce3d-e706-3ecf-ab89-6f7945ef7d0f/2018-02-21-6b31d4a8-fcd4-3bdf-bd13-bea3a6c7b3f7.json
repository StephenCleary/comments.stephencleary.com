If one of those methods throws an exception before Task.WhenAll, then that exception would be captured and placed on the Task (not raised directly). The WhenAll then observes that task and re-throws any exceptions.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible that the Task-returning method has a bug and may throw an exception directly. So, e.g., DoOperation0Async may throw an exception instead of returning a Task.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"0b02443e-494d-3ddd-ac59-4bbed42be0b7","date":"2018-02-21T13:55:59Z","timestamp":1519221359,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
