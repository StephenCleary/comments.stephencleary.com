So that thread is gone. When the operation completes, there's actually a thread that performs the completion of that task. await has an optimization where it will try to continue on that same thread, if possible. But it's a question of whether or not it can continue on the thread that completes the task, not on the thread the async method was on earlier. That thread is long gone.","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"b46f9538-58c7-39b3-a661-079eb12d59d7","date":"2017-04-25T13:49:03Z","timestamp":1493128143,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
