Ok - I'd got it in my head that something else was going on. In your ASP.Net Context example, you access Response but a comment implies that you can only do that because you kept the context. Why is that? What would this.Response be, then, if we hadn't have kept the context? Or is the point that the this.Response getter there is, really, getting the response from the Context - so that should be restored in order to ensure we don't end up dealing with some other (or perhaps a completely absent) Response?","postId":"2012_02_async-and-await-bb1cce3d-e706-3ecf-ab89-6f7945ef7d0f","replyTo":"a34a6131-5cca-323f-a364-d05070abda76","date":"2015-01-15T16:05:57Z","timestamp":1421337957,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_T4mhSyf8nL"}
