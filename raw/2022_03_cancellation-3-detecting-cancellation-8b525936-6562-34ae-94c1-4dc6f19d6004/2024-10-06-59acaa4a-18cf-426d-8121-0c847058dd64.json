Thanks for that!\n\nI have a question about something in this article, regarding this statement:\n\n\u003E If your code must do something different when a cancellation happens, then you can handle that in a catch block. Well, first, I\u2019d recommend taking a step back and asking yourself if you really have to do that, because **it\u2019s unusual and raises concerns about the code design** _(my emphasis)_, and it can be difficult to test as well. But if you must:\n\nWould you say if we want to provide feedback to a user that some job has been cancelled, that catching the \u0060OperationCanceledException\u0060 is the correct thing to do? Or would you say there\u0027s a more appropriate way to accomplish this?","date":"2024-10-06T21:56:22.5314736Z"}
