My problem is that the double array is not in a structure, it is a param in the call. Would you happen to have any pointers for handling a double array in this situation? The C function call is   \r\n uint queryNumOfServers(USHORT *NumOfServers, char ServerNames[8][16]);   \r\nand I'm working in C#.  \r\nThank you for your help.","postId":"2010_02_interop-multidimensional-arrays-of-7b610f70-aec9-3583-bee7-02915d5e2d9b","replyTo":"","date":"2013-09-10T01:08:41Z","timestamp":1378775321}
