However, I find there's still a little pain when you have to mix projects of different \"flavors\". One of my goals is to reuse sources as the best (at least in my mind): the NuGet-way is almost the only suitable for a decent job.  \r\nHowever, since publishing even the \"trashiest\" component would be a bit like shooting to a mosquito with a bazooka, I created this small utility which comes very useful in the everyday work: [https://github.com/highfield/MakePortable](https://github.com/highfield/MakePortable)  \r\nI'd take advantage to thank you for the several articles about concurrency as well: I found them very very useful.","postId":"2016_06_dotnet-netcore-versions-fb486c18-bd56-3bd0-aec5-ae70a663faa6","replyTo":"","date":"2016-09-15T14:41:47Z","timestamp":1473950507,"authorUserId":"disqus:mariovernari"}
