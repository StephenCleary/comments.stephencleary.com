However, trying to find downloads for all the earlier packages is proving very difficult.\r\n\r\nOf course, I could leave the old versions there - but I don't know if the uninstaller left them intact when it discovered I didn't have the package. So, a package is still needed to \"repair\" any harm done.\r\n\r\nSo, the advice at the end of this article looks like the rare gem I was looking for.\r\n\r\n[Although, there is no dotnet folder to be found, and I still can't find a package for 1.0.20624.39]","postId":"2016_06_dotnet-netcore-versions-fb486c18-bd56-3bd0-aec5-ae70a663faa6","replyTo":"","date":"2016-09-16T05:07:24Z","timestamp":1474002444,"authorUserId":"disqus:paulcoddington"}
