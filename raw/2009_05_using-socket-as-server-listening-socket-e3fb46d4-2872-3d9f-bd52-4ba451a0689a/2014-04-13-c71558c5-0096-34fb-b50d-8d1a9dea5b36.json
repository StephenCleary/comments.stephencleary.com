Thnx a lot...  \r\ni have one question. When a new connection is accepted, it communicates on different port number?? because in java when we create server socket we specify a particular port number, like ServerSocket serverSoc = new ServerSocket(8989). So server socket is listening at port 8989. What happens when multiple clients are requesting? New connection is accepted as Socket clientSoc = serverSoc.accept(). So what about port number?","postId":"2009_05_using-socket-as-server-listening-socket-e3fb46d4-2872-3d9f-bd52-4ba451a0689a","replyTo":"","date":"2014-04-13T22:21:46Z","timestamp":1397427706}
