This has been operational for many years. Then one day, the listening socket for HTTPS seemingly simply closed (HTTP was still open.) Our apps listener socket continually services new connections from other clients.\r\n\r\nCan a large amount of submissions from clients to the port cause this to close/crash? I only ask since there was a large number of submissions around this time. Is it possible for port exhaustion to cause the listener to close? The submissions came from same client. Confused, any small pointers greatly appreciated. Running on 2003 server. I could create a watcher thread to periodically attempt connections on 443 / 80 and if unable to connect then reattempt creation of the listening sockets.","postId":"2009_05_using-socket-as-server-listening-socket-e3fb46d4-2872-3d9f-bd52-4ba451a0689a","replyTo":"","date":"2017-10-06T10:30:23Z","timestamp":1507285823}
