Much appreciated. Adding logging on the Accept to see what the heck is happening. It's a once in a blue moon scenario so I'll just probs add this into the build and see when it crops up.\r\n\r\nAs you, I thought the backlogged connections would simply be rejected. Thanks for afirming my thoughts on this.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I did find buried in the logging already in place another potential issue with SSL connectivitiy. It looked to accept the connection but complained that \"error:140BA0E4:SSL routines:SSL_new:ssl ctx has no default ssl version\". I must not have been setting the default TLS/SSL method for SSL objects newly created from this CTX.\r\n\r\nGonna try adding in \"SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version( m_context, SSLv23_server_method());\" and try and simulate an occurence without an SSL version. Never seen this before. First time for everything. You learn something new everyday. :D\r\n\r\nCiao ... for now.
