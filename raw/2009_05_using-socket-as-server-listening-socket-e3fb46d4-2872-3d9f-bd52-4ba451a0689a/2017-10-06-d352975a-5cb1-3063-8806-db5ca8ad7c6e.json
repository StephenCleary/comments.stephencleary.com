They should be ignored (after logging, if you want). In particular, you don't want any kind of error preventing Accept from being called again.\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge, large number of connections cannot cause a listening socket to close on its own. If more connections come in than there is a backlog for, they would just be rejected automatically by the OS.","postId":"2009_05_using-socket-as-server-listening-socket-e3fb46d4-2872-3d9f-bd52-4ba451a0689a","replyTo":"11b5f03b-ad7b-3a59-820a-5dbfee4971e7","date":"2017-10-06T22:49:15Z","timestamp":1507330155}
