So it's equivalent to a remove from index 2 (`0,1,3,4,5,6`) followed by an insert at index 5 (`0,1,3,4,5,2,6`).","postId":"2009_07_interpreting-notifycollectionchangedeve-9e466c44-64e0-3e2d-9bba-5a1c675421e1","replyTo":"96f2d545-9d2b-35ec-bbd6-6a9279f1cb54","date":"2018-01-16T15:03:37Z","timestamp":1516115017}
