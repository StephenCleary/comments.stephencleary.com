Raised is the past tense and the past participle of raise, which means to lift or elevate. Rose is the past tense of rise, which means to ascend from a lower position to a higher position. So in the context of the story, you would write that He raised Lazurus, but He himself rose from the dead.\n\nI am responding here rather than from that page because there is no comment option on that page.\n","date":"2023-09-08T14:00:36.7602994Z"}
