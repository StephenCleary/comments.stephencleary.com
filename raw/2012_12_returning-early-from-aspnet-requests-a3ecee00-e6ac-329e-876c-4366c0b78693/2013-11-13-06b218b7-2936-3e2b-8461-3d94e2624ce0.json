The ASP.NET request then returns to the app.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a background worker independent of the ASP.NET request (e.g., an Azure Worker Role) is processing the queue, generating the thumbnails, and saving them to reliable storage (e.g., an Azure Blob).  \r\n\r\nAfter the thumbnail is generated, the background worker can notify the client via SignalR. Alternatively, the client could poll the ASP.NET server until the thumbnail is ready.","postId":"2012_12_returning-early-from-aspnet-requests-a3ecee00-e6ac-329e-876c-4366c0b78693","replyTo":"","date":"2013-11-13T03:17:21Z","timestamp":1384312641}
