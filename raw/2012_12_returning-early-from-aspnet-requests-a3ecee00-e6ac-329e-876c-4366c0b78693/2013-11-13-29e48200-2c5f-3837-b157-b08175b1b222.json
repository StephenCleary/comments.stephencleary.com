I have a working code to generate thumbnail for DOCX documents and it involves intermediate step of converting the DOCX to PDF and then to a JPEG. This whole process takes anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds and I do not want to block the calling application because thumbnail generation can be done in background and user does not need to see it immediately. Thumbnail generation is done on a different server. I do not want the calling thread to wait until thumbnail is generated. What are my options here?","postId":"2012_12_returning-early-from-aspnet-requests-a3ecee00-e6ac-329e-876c-4366c0b78693","replyTo":"","date":"2013-11-13T02:21:02Z","timestamp":1384309262,"authorUserId":""}
