Even if the response is just \"OK\" or \"Error\", that's still a response.  \r\n\r\nIn your scenario, I recommend using an asynchronous file stream (constructed with \"useAsync\" set to \"true\") and using \"await\". This will free up the ASP.NET thread while the file is being written out, yet not actually complete the request (sending \"OK\" or \"Error\") until the file has been written.","postId":"2012_12_returning-early-from-aspnet-requests-a3ecee00-e6ac-329e-876c-4366c0b78693","replyTo":"","date":"2013-11-01T00:56:59Z","timestamp":1383267419,"authorUserId":""}
