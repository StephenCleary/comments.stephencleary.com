My case is we want to send an email (SMTP or REST api call) after the response finishes. The email sending can take up to several seconds. If the email fails to send, we log it to a file and retry it again later in a clean up process. For these reasons I think fire and forget is perfectly legit as the browser doesn't need to wait for all that.   \r\n\r\nAnyway... my question: is AspNetBackgroundTasks any better/safer than ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem?
