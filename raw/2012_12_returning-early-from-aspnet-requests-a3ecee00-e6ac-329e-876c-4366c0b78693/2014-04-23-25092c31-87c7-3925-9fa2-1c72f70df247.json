I would think that should get us *fairly* close to zero loss. Considering the general success rate of email getting into an in--box, I think we are good as we need to be. :)  \r\n\r\nWe went down the windows service road in the beginning to send emails, and it's a pain. I have long thought it would be nice if [asp.net](http://asp.net \"asp.net\") had a supported, in-the-box thread/queue/whatever for long running processes that don't need a request/response. Thanks for the AspNetBackgroundTasks project!","postId":"2012_12_returning-early-from-aspnet-requests-a3ecee00-e6ac-329e-876c-4366c0b78693","replyTo":"","date":"2014-04-23T23:48:17Z","timestamp":1398296897,"authorUserId":""}
