I am having a RTP over UDP connection between a client-server over WiFi. I want to be notified at the client side, if the communication link between them is broken. I stream live video captured from server to the client. And hence I want a detection mechanism that is acceptable in real time.  I was considering using the timeout mechanism at the client(solution 3), that sends an event in case it is not reset. What do you suggest? I think keeping alive does not make sense in UDP as you explained earlier in the comments.  Are there any other mechanisms? May be also periodically using command `ping` to check for connection?? How does that sound to you?","date":"2018-09-18T09:04:34.373Z"}
