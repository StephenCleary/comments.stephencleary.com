Can you please provide your thought.\r\n\r\nOur client B is connected to TCP server A.\r\n\r\nAlso to note B is communicating with a service C over IPC.\r\n\r\nSo traditionally request from A would be passed to B(over TCP) and than to C (Over IpC).\r\n\r\nAnd the response is from C-B (over IPC) and B to A over TCP.\r\n\r\nNow here the problem we are facing(problem since it happen randomly)\r\n\r\nWe see all request from A logged in our log. Like wise response that is about to sent to A (received by B from C) from B is being and logged as well(which exist in our log).\r\n\r\nNow there are time when we are being informed that A is not getting response.\r\n\r\nWe then confirm this with ngrep.\r\n\r\nNow the thing is if we restart C we see the message getting sent to A from B  \r\nNot sure what is the reason for this.\r\n\r\nSame happen if we restart B . We see the old messages (those were stuck) getting passed.not sure how that happened too.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time B receive message from A and response from C.\r\n\r\nIts so annoying we are not able to track it and solve it from past 2 week.
