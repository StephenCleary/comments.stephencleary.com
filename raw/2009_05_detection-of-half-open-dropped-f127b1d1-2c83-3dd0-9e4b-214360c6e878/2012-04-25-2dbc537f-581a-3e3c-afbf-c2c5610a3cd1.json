If that's acceptable for your app, then that's all you need.  \r\n\r\nMost apps prefer to detect dropped connections sooner than 2 hours. In that case, you need to pass IOControlCode.KeepAliveValues to Socket.IOControl with an unmanaged SIO_KEEPALIVE_VALS structure.  \r\n\r\nI do not have a code sample, sorry!","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"","date":"2012-04-25T04:40:04Z","timestamp":1335328804}
