My application is a TCP Client that connects to a server and receives messages...from time to time I want to know if the server is still alive. For the moment i have implement in the MainForm_Load sub (VB.NET):  \r\n\r\ntcpSocket = New Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp)  \r\n tcpSocket.SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel.Socket, SocketOptionName.KeepAlive, True)  \r\n SetKeepAlive(tcpSocket, keepalivetime, keepaliveinterval)  \r\n\r\nAlso I am wondering how my loop that reads data is announced that the server is OFF, by TCP KeepAlive signal?","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"","date":"2012-04-25T16:41:37Z","timestamp":1335372097}
