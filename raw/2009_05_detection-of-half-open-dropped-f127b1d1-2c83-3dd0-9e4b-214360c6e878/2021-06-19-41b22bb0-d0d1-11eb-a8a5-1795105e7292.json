Here is the question\r\n\r\nIf a TCP connection is established but your computer network cable is unplugged (half open connection), if you write some data to this connection what happens ? \r\nI answered that the connection responds with an error message as no data ACK is received back as the network is down. \r\nIs this correct ? or is something else expected? \r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your wonderful blog","date":"2021-06-19T07:37:53.654Z"}
