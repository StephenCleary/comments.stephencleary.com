I've a question regarding usage of PING for detecting connection loss. Lot of membership protocols use PING to identify the failure of a member. My understanding from your article is that, PING can be used to check if the member is available and reachable, but doesn't necessarily guarantee if the previously opened socket is intact or not. Can you provide more information on this? Thanks!","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"","date":"2017-07-20T18:44:24Z","timestamp":1500576264,"authorUserId":"disqus:chandrasekharthumuluru"}
