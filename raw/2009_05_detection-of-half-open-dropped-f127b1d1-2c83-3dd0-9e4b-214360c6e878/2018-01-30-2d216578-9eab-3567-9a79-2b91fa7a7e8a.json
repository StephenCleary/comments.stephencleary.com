So if you're using `select` to do your timeout, you could only have one socket in your `select` sets. This would defeat the purpose of `select`, since you'd end up using one thread per socket anyway.","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"fc04a314-6454-3e55-9f69-2d45debc1f79","date":"2018-01-30T13:44:43Z","timestamp":1517319883,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
