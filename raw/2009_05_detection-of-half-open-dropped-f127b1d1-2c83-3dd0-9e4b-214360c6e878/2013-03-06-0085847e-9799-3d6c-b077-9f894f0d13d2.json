Technically, there is no actual \"connection\"; when the API docs talk about a \"connection\" all that really means is that you're setting local default values for future operations.  \r\n\r\nSo it really doesn't make sense to check for a \"connection\". However, you can send a keepalive to the other side to see if it's still there, just like TCP. But if the \"keepalive\" doesn't make it, there is no built-in NAK or notification that it failed. And UDP has no built-in retries, so if a keepalive fails it doesn't *necessarily* mean that the other side isn't there.","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"","date":"2013-03-06T20:52:36Z","timestamp":1362603156}
