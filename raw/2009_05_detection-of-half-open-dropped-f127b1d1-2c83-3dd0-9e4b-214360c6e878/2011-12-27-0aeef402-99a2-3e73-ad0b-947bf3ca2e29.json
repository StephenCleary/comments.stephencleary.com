What I found on internet is that with sending urgent data (as a separate stream) on existing connection, I'm able to notice if connection is still alive before sending response back ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Out_of_band_data)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Out_of_band_data)). That is very good solution and I already implemented it under java (sendUrgentData), but so far I was unable to find such solution for C#. Can you try to solve this issue under C# using hidden data (out_of_band_data)? Is there methods (or approaches) for sending hidden data under C#?  \r\n\r\nThank you for your responses on this matter. I hope I helped you to find good solution for checking out terminated connections.  \r\n\r\nBR  \r\npecko","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"","date":"2011-12-27T17:05:22Z","timestamp":1325005522,"authorUserId":""}
