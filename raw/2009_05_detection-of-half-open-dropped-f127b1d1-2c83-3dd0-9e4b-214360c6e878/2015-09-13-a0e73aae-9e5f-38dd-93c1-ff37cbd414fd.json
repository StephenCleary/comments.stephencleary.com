It is *possible* that the keepalive packets are being swallowed by an intermediate router.\r\n\r\nI always recommend explicit keepalives whenever possible, because that gives you the best control over timing, and routers aren't allowed to drop them. If you control both sides, I'd recommend that.","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"900bae25-2022-310b-aeb0-241f2c415e97","date":"2015-09-13T05:28:49Z","timestamp":1442122129,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
