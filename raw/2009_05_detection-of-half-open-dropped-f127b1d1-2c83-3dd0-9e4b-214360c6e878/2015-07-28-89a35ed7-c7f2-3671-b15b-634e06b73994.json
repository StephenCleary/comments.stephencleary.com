The c++ program has a loop that sends a read request every other second to the c# program and then the c# program sends its response back. This part of the implementation works correctly. But I found a weird behavior when I added a different function (which is triggered by the user) that will make the read loop be idle for three seconds. The problem can only be seen if the function is triggered between send() and recv() calls. If this is the case I received a return -1 from the recv(). I have to mention that the c# program sends the response in less than 1 second so the method that is calling the send() and recv() commands goes idle at the time the data is transferred. I thought that if the process is not terminated, the data will wait in a buffer for a recv() commands. I wanted to know if this could be a case of half-open connections or I just have a bad implementation. I know it is really hard to say without taking a look to the code, but I would appreciate some general idea/comments about this issue.","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"","date":"2015-07-28T17:04:46Z","timestamp":1438103086}
