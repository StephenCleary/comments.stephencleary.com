This is probably why it isn't explicit in the MSDN documentation.\r\n\r\n\"Keep-alive packets MUST only be sent when no data or  \r\n acknowledgement packets have been received for the  \r\n connection within an interval. This interval MUST be  \r\n configurable and MUST default to no less than two hours.\"  \r\n-- [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#page-101](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#page-101)\r\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend changing the TCP keepalive interval as a solution. This is just one more thing you have to remember to do if you want to deploy your app to another server. IMHO, keeping idle connections open is the responsibility of the application and should be handled at the application layer.","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"","date":"2015-05-28T20:52:08Z","timestamp":1432846328,"authorUserId":"disqus:Mikeeeeeeeee"}
