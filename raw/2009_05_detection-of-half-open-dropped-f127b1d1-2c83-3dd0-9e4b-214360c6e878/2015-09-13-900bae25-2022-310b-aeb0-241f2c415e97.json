But this close is not sending FIN to the client side. So client side has no idea about the connection is closed.   \r\nkeepalive is used in both sides.  \r\nIt is hard to tell and understand the exact scenario, but i would appreciate any comments about this issue.","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"","date":"2015-09-13T03:59:44Z","timestamp":1442116784,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_nfoKGHqVl2"}
