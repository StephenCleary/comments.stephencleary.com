(As an aside, the MSDN examples for sockets are horrifyingly bad; at some point, I do plan to do a blog series just on fixing them). Zero-byte sends have to be special-cased through the network stack (which Microsoft does but other platforms do not), and any intermediate router is permitted to always drop those packets. So I consider this solution unreliable in the general case (i.e., the Internet).","postId":"2009_05_detection-of-half-open-dropped-f127b1d1-2c83-3dd0-9e4b-214360c6e878","replyTo":"","date":"2014-05-02T17:54:59Z","timestamp":1399053299}
