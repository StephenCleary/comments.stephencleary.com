Your articles are awesome but I am reading it many times to figure it out completely. One thing that confuses me while using async await and Task.Run is that\r\n\r\nComing from backgroundworker thread background, I run (beginWorkerAsync) it for long processes in my winform and when I need to update UI I call INVOKE, but if I have to update it to using async j/ await / Task.Run then I think I might do the following\r\n\r\n1) Use Task.Run and then should I update UI from there using INVOKE? But if I use this approach is it not the same as backgroundworker with the only advantage I see here is might be less code or more readability?\r\n\r\n2) I just can't think how async await fits in for my requirement because most of my code is CPU intensive and if I use it, it still runs on UI thread and hence freezes my UI\r\n\r\n3) Is async await only useful for Network scenario, as far as keeping UI responsive is concerned?\r\n\r\nThanks.","postId":"2017_09_happy-birthday-async-4abb0050-b281-3a1c-a271-8815945e5d18","replyTo":"8a505fd6-8c1d-3e8b-8042-3787f84c3924","date":"2017-12-08T03:34:08Z","timestamp":1512704048,"authorUserId":"disqus:sujitkumarsingh"}
