I have been a BackgroundWorker fan my whole c# career....until I stumbled across this blog post.  \r\n\r\nWOW - you explained it so simply.  And while I'm still wrapping my head around how to do everything I used to do with BackgroundWorker - I have begun to use Task.Run exclusively going forward.    Very cool alternative to BackgroundWorker. \r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to post this.    I advise any other BackgroundWorker fans out there to give this a try.   You won't be sorry.","date":"2022-02-05T21:46:34.554Z"}
