It\u0027s helped me convert a BackgroundWorker in a legacy application into async/await syntax, so that I could then nest a timeout-cancellable async call to an Excel Interop component which was hanging the application when trying to open .xlsx files over an unreliable network connection.\n\nThe critical problem I was having you\u0027ve mentioned right on this first page: \u0022BackgroundWorker doesn\u2019t work well with async code. An async DoWork handler will exit early, causing the RunWorkerCompleted to fire before the method is completed.\u0022\n\nFound the link to this intro from your answer on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61216810/run-async-await-task-in-backgroundworkers-runworkercompleted\n","date":"2024-11-26T14:18:35.0698211Z"}
