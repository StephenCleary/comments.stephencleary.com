So there should be a straightforward way to do this without BGW or Task.Run at all.\r\n\r\nIn general, you can start an async operation by just calling the method and not doing an await right away; instead, just save the Task in a variable and await it later (possibly using Task.WhenAll or Task.WhenAny).\r\n\r\nThat same strategy can be used with Task.Run, but again it sounds like there would be a better solution without Task.Run or BGW at all.","postId":"2013_05_taskrun-vs-backgroundworker-intro-e1767ce3-e564-37c3-ba47-ad1dfcfaba51","replyTo":"a18c0153-26fc-3d80-97ba-0cfd969789e0","date":"2014-09-24T00:46:32Z","timestamp":1411519592}
