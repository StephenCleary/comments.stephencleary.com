From what I can tell, there's no way to get the token from the returned task. So what difference does it make if it's some token or another? The documentation doesn't say and others discussing it on the Web that I found are also silent on this, except this guy writing: [http://www.codeproject.com/...](http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/838284/New-Features-in-the-NET-Framework-Related-to-Task \"http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/838284/New-Features-in-the-NET-Framework-Related-to-Task\"). But:  \r\n• If it's only whether an exception should be thrown, why not offer an overload takin a Boolean? (In addition to the present one, since I recognize that it may be convenient to pass in some CancellationToken at hand, possibly even with IsCancellationRequested not yet statically certain at this point.)  \r\n• It seems that what callers want most of the time is to definitely have a successful cancellation, not an exception. So why not a parameterless (nullary) overload assuming True?\r\n\r\nOr am I missing something? Is there more to this CancellationToken argument than just a Boolean wrapped in something fancy?","postId":"2015_04_a-tour-of-task-part-10-promise-tasks-76cdd5a7-1909-3432-9e00-8acd3cd4350c","replyTo":"","date":"2016-08-19T21:39:40Z","timestamp":1471642780,"authorUserId":"disqus:krzysztofmaczyski"}
