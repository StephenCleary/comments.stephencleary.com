It all makes good sense and it does make my job easier, but only if I am perfect enough to always call Dispose in my disposable classes. I find, however, that I want to add a finalizer and GC.SuppressFinalize in Dispose anyway because I can put logging into the finalizer to detect when I fail to properly call dispose. Is there a simpler, more elegant way to detect failure to dispose for an application in the field?","postId":"2009_08_second-rule-of-implementing-idisposable-7a1a789c-9a61-3596-ac63-8d78ef6528a5","replyTo":"","date":"2012-03-23T02:34:32Z","timestamp":1332470072,"authorUserId":""}
