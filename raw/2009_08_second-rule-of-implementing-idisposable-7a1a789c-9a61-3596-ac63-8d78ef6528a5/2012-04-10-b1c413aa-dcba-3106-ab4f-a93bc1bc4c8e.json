Due to slow performance when making the connection, the connection is made once in the constructor and I expose a Disconnect() method that delegates to the api.Disconnect() method.  \r\n\r\nHowever, I cannot be certain that users of my class will always call my Disconnect() method, and I want to make absolutely sure that the connection is closed when my object is disposed/finalized. Even though I do not have unmanaged resources, is this a case where a finalizer (and the full Dispose pattern) is needed? Otherwise how can I ensure the connection is closed and I do not have a leak?  \r\n\r\nMany thanks","postId":"2009_08_second-rule-of-implementing-idisposable-7a1a789c-9a61-3596-ac63-8d78ef6528a5","replyTo":"","date":"2012-04-10T20:53:08Z","timestamp":1334091188}
