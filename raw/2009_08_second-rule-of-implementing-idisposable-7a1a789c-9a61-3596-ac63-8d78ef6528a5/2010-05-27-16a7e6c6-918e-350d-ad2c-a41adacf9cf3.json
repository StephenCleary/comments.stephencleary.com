I guess it is mainly a design thing. It's not related just to the Dispose method. If you need to test for null in the Dispose you should have to test for null in every method where you'll be using the instance. It should indeed just be so that it will always be instanced and your unit tests should be able to pick it up if some other developer screws up and deletes the reference or disposes it too early.","postId":"2009_08_second-rule-of-implementing-idisposable-7a1a789c-9a61-3596-ac63-8d78ef6528a5","replyTo":"","date":"2010-05-27T12:38:05Z","timestamp":1274963885}
