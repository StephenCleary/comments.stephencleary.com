In this situation, the Microsoft pattern would have a finalizer that essentially does nothing (it would call Dispose in a way that Dispose had no work to do). It is completely wrong to dispose managed resources from a finalizer, and there are no unmanaged resources to dispose.","postId":"2009_08_second-rule-of-implementing-idisposable-7a1a789c-9a61-3596-ac63-8d78ef6528a5","replyTo":"","date":"2013-11-15T18:21:14Z","timestamp":1384539674,"authorUserId":""}
