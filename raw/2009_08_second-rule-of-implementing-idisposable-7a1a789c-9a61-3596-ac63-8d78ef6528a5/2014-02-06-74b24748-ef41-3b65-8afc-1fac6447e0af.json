If they don't, then no one does. The GC will invoke finalizers, which will clean up resources so there's no resource leaks.  \r\n\r\nHowever, some types require a Dispose call for correctness (e.g., to flush a buffer to a stream); those Dispose methods *must* be called by the client. If you try to call Dispose from a finalizer, it runs too late, and you'll end up with a race condition that could potentially crash your application.","postId":"2009_08_second-rule-of-implementing-idisposable-7a1a789c-9a61-3596-ac63-8d78ef6528a5","replyTo":"","date":"2014-02-06T17:39:08Z","timestamp":1391708348}
