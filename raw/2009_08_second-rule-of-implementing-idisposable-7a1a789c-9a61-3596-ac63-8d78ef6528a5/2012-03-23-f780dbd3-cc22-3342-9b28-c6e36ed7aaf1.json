However, all of my more recent code just ignores this situation. AFAIK, there just isn't a good way to detect it other than in a finalizer, and your code is so restricted in a finalizer that there isn't much you can do even when you do detect it...","postId":"2009_08_second-rule-of-implementing-idisposable-7a1a789c-9a61-3596-ac63-8d78ef6528a5","replyTo":"","date":"2012-03-23T05:16:46Z","timestamp":1332479806,"authorUserId":""}
