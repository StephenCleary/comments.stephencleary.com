I don't really care what happens during exit. I can't crash in a kiosk sort of situation. So it's what might otherwise leak in a long-running app for lack of Dispose calls that I try to catch from looking at plain text logs written within the Finalize. One logging call is all the extra work I do in a Finalize. I have found a few missing Disposes this way. My intention is to eventually remove the finalizers and conform to the rules you lay out, but for now the finalizers are a handy tool for debugging unattended systems.","postId":"2009_08_second-rule-of-implementing-idisposable-7a1a789c-9a61-3596-ac63-8d78ef6528a5","replyTo":"","date":"2012-03-23T06:37:28Z","timestamp":1332484648,"authorUserId":""}
