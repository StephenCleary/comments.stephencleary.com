By that I mean that it'll just be *expected* that everyone knows how to use async/await.  \r\n\r\nRegarding the technical level, I decided at the beginning that my blog would be on the \"harder\" end of things. There's a lot of places out there that cover the simpler stuff, so I figured I'd try tackling the harder problems. Also, any time I found something that wasn't sufficiently documented or just took me a long time to figure out, I'd write up a blog post. Some of my blog posts here represent 2-3 days of solid work, experimenting, digging with Reflector/JustDecompile, etc.  \r\n\r\nSometimes it's difficult to explain the harder concepts, though. If I am ever unclear in what I'm saying, please do bring it up!  \r\n\r\nThanks,  \r\n -Steve","postId":"2013_05_taskrun-vs-backgroundworker-round-1-b69afd34-80d1-3c0f-9885-0555b3d7c797","replyTo":"","date":"2013-05-12T16:09:37Z","timestamp":1368374977,"authorUserId":""}
