If you’re using BackgroundWorker for asynchronous or parallel work then just stop; you’re not using the right tool in the first place. The core problem for BackgroundWorker is to execute synchronous code on a background thread.\"\r\n\r\nJust when I thought I understand parallel coding in .net. I read the above statement. And now I am afraid I am in a position where I am asking myself.. Doesn't background code mean async code ?  \r\nCould you please shed some light on the your quoted statement. Thank you.","postId":"2013_05_taskrun-vs-backgroundworker-round-1-b69afd34-80d1-3c0f-9885-0555b3d7c797","replyTo":"","date":"2015-03-03T09:45:06Z","timestamp":1425375906}
