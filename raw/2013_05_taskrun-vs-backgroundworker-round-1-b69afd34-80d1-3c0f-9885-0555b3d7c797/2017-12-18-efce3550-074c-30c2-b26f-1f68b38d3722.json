I've been trying to use Task.Factory to execute some long running calls however my issue comes in with the ContinueWith() function which also runs on a thread separate from the UI thread, where RunWorkerCompleted() doesn't. This is all good and well unless you need to navigate to another window or shutdown the application, both of which need to be called from the UI thread.","postId":"2013_05_taskrun-vs-backgroundworker-round-1-b69afd34-80d1-3c0f-9885-0555b3d7c797","replyTo":"","date":"2017-12-18T12:50:54Z","timestamp":1513601454}
