Thanks for sharing.\r\n\r\nJust noticed there's a small bug in the code. In the first code snippet, the `compilation` object is defined twice within the same context. I assume the intention was to overwrite the second one with the return value of `AddSyntaxTrees`; although maybe the alternative intention was to create a completely separate object? Either way, it might be good to fix it. This code is still 100% relevant in 2022.","date":"2022-11-16T02:46:47.395Z"}
