It didn't take off like I thought it would - I think it's a bit too complex to reason about, particularly with asynchronous code. With scheduled concurrency, asynchronous code is first broken up in to synchronous pieces and *then* scheduled, so the granularity doesn't match what people expect. Most people have ended up using my AsyncEx library (or rolling their own) instead.","postId":"2012_08_async-and-scheduled-concurrency-557c7a26-e90e-3b4f-ac4d-c851f47bbb2d","replyTo":"5c460e43-f88a-31d6-8450-539d08e4309c","date":"2017-01-14T14:50:42Z","timestamp":1484405442,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
