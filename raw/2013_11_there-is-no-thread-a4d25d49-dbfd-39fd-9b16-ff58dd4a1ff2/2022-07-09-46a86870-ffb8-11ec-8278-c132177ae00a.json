To consider this disk example, that would be correct: there's a separate processing unit inside the disk controller that performs the actual write. It's not really a \"thread\", but it is an independent processing unit.\r\n\r\n`async` in general can also perform higher-order work. For example, when you `await` an `HttpClient` method, that task won't complete until the information is written to the network and then some time later a response is received from the remote machine. So in general, `async` can react to any kind of \"event\", even when there are no local devices involved at all.","date":"2022-07-09T18:52:26.750Z"}
