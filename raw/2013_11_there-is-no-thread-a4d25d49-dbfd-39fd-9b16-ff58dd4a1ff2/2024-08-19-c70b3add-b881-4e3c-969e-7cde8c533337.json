There\u0027s one inaccuracy re APC. APC approach is **not** the same as IOCP one. With APC, the I/O completion callback is executed within the *same* thread that launched asynchronous I/O operation and only if that thread is _alertable_ state (see Microsoft documentation for more details). With IOCP approach, which is used by C# thread pool, the thread that runs continuation after I/O is completed has nothing to do with the thread that started the asynchronous operation.","date":"2024-08-19T23:34:49.0732195Z"}
