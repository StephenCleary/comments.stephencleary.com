But now I have a question on \"CPU-based operations are not asynchronous, by definition\". I suppose by this you mean that the CPU can execute one \"task\" at a time. If this is what you mean, then aren't you forgetting the multi-core CPUs? Each core can execute one task...OK I'm not sure now when you wrote that article if we actually had multi-core CPUs...\r\n\r\nThanks again for the article and the answer...\r\n\r\nR,  \r\nG.P.","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"6625935a-675b-3d3e-aa17-db5949bf81d3","date":"2016-05-09T14:12:07Z","timestamp":1462803127}
