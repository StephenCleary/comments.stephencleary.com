(like 10 iothreads per core). Because many article recommend user to increase 'MinIoThread' for better IO performance and people said it actually affect to performance. Moreover, default value of 'MaxIoThread' is 1000.\r\n\r\nIt depends on situation but as I know, if there's no blocking method in thread loop except GQCS, we don't need thread more than number of processor. And also coreclr limits number of release IOCP thread to number of processor. (https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/vm/win32threadpool.cpp#L456)\r\n\r\nSo I can't quite understand why we need more than two thread per core, Is there any blocking logic in iothread or am I missing something?","date":"2019-01-24T06:25:45.672Z"}
