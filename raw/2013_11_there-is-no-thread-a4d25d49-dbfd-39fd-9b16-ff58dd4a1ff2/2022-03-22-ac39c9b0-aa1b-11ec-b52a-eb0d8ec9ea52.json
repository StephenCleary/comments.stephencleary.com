I have had very large numbers of concurrent tasks. Really, at that point, they're just in-memory state machines that are in a list waiting for the semaphore.\r\n\r\nThat said, 10e7 of them can cause some memory pressure, and you may want to throttle the *creation* of the tasks as well as the *execution* of those tasks. TPL Dataflow may help if you have a more complex pipeline.","date":"2022-03-22T20:07:17.345Z"}
