Imagining it that way, it seems not using IOCP or async operations is rather a brutal waste of the I/O thread(s) which are already allocated to an AppDomain.\r\n\r\nOne small doubt. I understand all this discussion applies to XyzAsync() calls. Is the same also true for the BeginXyz() calls? I mean, I'm still with VS2008 (.Net 3.5), so does using the BeginXyz() methods also provide the exact same benefits as using the later XyzAsync() counterparts? If there are any specific drawbacks to the old methods, I'd love to read about those if you can point me to a link. Many thanks.","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"5e64b4f3-00f2-31ec-ac78-14adcc352b51","date":"2017-12-28T11:51:35Z","timestamp":1514461895,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_j9TS7gArn0"}
