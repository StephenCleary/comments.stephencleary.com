Instead, it queues the continuation of that method onto the UI context, and the UI thread will resume executing that method when it gets around to it.\"\r\n\r\nHow about Console applications and Windows Service application? My assumption is that it will resume the async method directly on the thread pool thread, correct?\r\n\r\nI couldn't find any article that take console application / Windows Service as a main example. Questions that bother me all the time are:   \r\n1. what type of synchronization context it will be for these two types of applications?\r\n\r\n2. Could any deadlock in async code be there for these two types of applications?","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"","date":"2015-11-27T17:05:36Z","timestamp":1448643936,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_4WnuRt9ngP"}
