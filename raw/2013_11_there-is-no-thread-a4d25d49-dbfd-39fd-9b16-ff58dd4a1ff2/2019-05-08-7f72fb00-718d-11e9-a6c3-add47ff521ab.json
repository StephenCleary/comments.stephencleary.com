How about now? Anything yet? So lonely… — no. DOS services register an interrupt handler to handle ISRs from the keyboard, make note of the press, then resumes whatever else was going on. Nothing ever actually sits and actively waits… except possibly the CPU itself put into an idle power management state waiting (passively!) for that eventual ISR.","date":"2019-05-08T12:33:35.885Z"}
