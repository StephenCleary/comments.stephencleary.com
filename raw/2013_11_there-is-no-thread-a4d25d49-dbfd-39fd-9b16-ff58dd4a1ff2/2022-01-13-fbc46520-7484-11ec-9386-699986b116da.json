You are claiming that there is no thread, but there still is parallel processing: the UI thread works in parallel with the hardrive. I don't care whether the harddrive requires a thread or not.\r\n\r\nIn the comments you clarify that not having a thread will multiply server throughput, because IO/Network operations won't block your precious CPU cores. From this perspective not having a thread is definitely relevant. Maybe you could add these to points of view to the end of your article?\r\n\r\nApart from that, it was a fascinating read, and I really liked your humoristic writing style :).","date":"2022-01-13T15:25:05.240Z"}
