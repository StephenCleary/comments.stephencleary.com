One major benefit that Node has is that it *forces* developers to use asynchrony (it has to, since it only has one thread). ASP.NET only *allows* developers to use asynchrony, and a lot of devs just don't take advantage of it (or can't, if some third-party library doesn't support asynchrony).\r\n\r\nIn the Node world, if you have a multicore CPU, one common option is to run multiple node webserver instances, and tie them together with a load balancer like nginx (all on the same box). While this works, I think it's more complex to get right than the out-of-the-box parallelism (with asynchrony) that ASP.NET provides.","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"dd8249c7-5dd0-3542-a3bb-30c26e02ab14","date":"2017-12-26T18:20:41Z","timestamp":1514312441}
