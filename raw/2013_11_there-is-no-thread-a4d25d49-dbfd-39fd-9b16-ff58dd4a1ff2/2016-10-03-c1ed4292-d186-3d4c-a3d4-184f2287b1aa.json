A background thread may be treated asynchronously by the UI thread, and would be \"asynchronous\" from the UI thread's perspective. On the other hand, I/O is \"asynchronous\" from a much broader scope (it would be \"asynchronous\" from the perspective of *any* thread, or process, or the OS, or the CPU).","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"837f091a-f954-3af5-8085-5b04c1d6058a","date":"2016-10-03T18:41:55Z","timestamp":1475520115}
