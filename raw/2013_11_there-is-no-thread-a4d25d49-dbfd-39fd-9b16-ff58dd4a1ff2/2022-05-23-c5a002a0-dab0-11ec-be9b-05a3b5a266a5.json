This really cleared up a lot of confusion I had. \r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with how \"devices\" work. When you say \"Some time after the write request started, the device finishes writing. It notifies the CPU via an interrupt.\", there are threads in the processor of the device itself executing the write request right? So \"there is no thread\" means there is no thread in the computer which is running the async code, but there are threads in the I/O devices servicing these requests?","date":"2022-05-23T15:55:31.194Z"}
