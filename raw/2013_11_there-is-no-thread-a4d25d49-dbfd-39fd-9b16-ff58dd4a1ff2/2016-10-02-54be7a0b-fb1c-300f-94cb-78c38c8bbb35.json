Nice comment on that topic.\r\n\r\nBut wait, and, sorry, that I comment that late. Perhaps we need an explained sample code, which does not involve io at that level. Let's say, the method, which is being awaited to finish execution, simply calculates complex stuff like matrix multiplications, whatsoever. Where is this execution context present if not in a threadpool thread?  \r\nTh UI remains responsive. The asynch method is re-invoked at the first statement after the await keyword (continuations allow the recreation of the context,etc...), and the callstack now changed dramatically. This can only be explained with an additional threadpool thread, can't it?","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"65415d44-a506-3348-99ad-5ad5193bd670","date":"2016-10-02T09:37:35Z","timestamp":1475401055}
