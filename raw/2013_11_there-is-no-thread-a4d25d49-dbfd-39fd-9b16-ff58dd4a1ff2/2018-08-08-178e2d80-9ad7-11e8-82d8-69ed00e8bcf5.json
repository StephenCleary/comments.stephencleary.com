Delegate tasks must run on some kind of Thread-pool thread since you must use a thread to run CPU bound code.\r\n2. Promise tasks are actually the real async operations. They use a Task an a \"interface\" wrapper but no thread is allocated since there is no use for one.\r\n\r\nAm I correct here? \r\n\r\nTasks are complex and I couldn't find an in-depth blog (yours is the closest). Most of the blogs focus on the async state machine. Can you also recommend a source for a behind the scenes on Tasks? I'm currently reading the source code using ILSpy and reading your blog, but I would like to go deeper.","date":"2018-08-08T06:48:44.263Z"}
