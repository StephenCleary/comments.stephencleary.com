However, these limitations may be removed in future kernel versions. For this reason, I tend to write all my I/O as asynchronous; if I'm appending to a file and the OS makes it synchronous, it's possible for a future OS update to make it asynchronous. If I write my I/O as synchronous, then I can't benefit from future OS improvements around asynchrony without changing my code.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would recommend running performance tests with both async and sync file I/O running in your particular scenario. Last time I checked, there were some performance concerns with using BCL async file I/O heavily.","date":"2018-10-24T20:59:05.966Z"}
