You will find people asking about this around the web, but I've never found a good answer that wasn't a snarky \"if you don't know then you don't deserve to know\".\r\n\r\nThe epiphany comes when realizing how you need to make the stack async all the way down to the hardware device, which then allows the language to free up the thread by interfacing with the device handle. It also makes it clear why putting some blocking operation inside an async method won't achieve anything other than maybe allowing you to run it concurrently.","date":"2021-10-25T17:38:16.966Z"}
