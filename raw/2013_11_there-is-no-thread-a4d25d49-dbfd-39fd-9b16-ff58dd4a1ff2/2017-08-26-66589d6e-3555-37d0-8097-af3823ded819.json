You assume that the correct usage scenario of async is not a cpu bound but an io bound activity and that, in such a correct usage scenario, together with other truly async driver/kernel/etc... io functions, this dotnet \"async/await\" language feature - as opposite to a Task.Run - results in - 1 thread, correct?\r\n\r\nP.S. In other words, maybe more explicitly, do you agree with what DavidFowl writes about async/await in this comment: \"The basic motivation for Async I/O is to boost performance That doesn't have anything to do with async/await though. AKA it is NOT the basis, nor is it required for async/await to function. Async/await is just C#'s represenation of co-routines.\" [https://stackoverflow.com/q...](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45808446/p-invoke-and-overlapped-i-o-in-core-clr-on-unix#comment78756598_45808446 \"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45808446/p-invoke-and-overlapped-i-o-in-core-clr-on-unix#comment78756598_45808446\")","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"281fadd1-662c-35ed-9354-8a4279e863e1","date":"2017-08-26T09:03:43Z","timestamp":1503738223,"authorUserId":"disqus:machine_learning"}
