But I think the sample is too simplistic because it implies there is a BCL equivalent call to the .NET statement of WriteAsynch. What happens when some simple .NET statements like \"var a = 10 + 12\" happens? That code must be run on a thread using Gen'd IML code. In fact, when debugging Task.Factory.Start.... in the debugger by threads, we see a new thread for each start don't we?","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"","date":"2014-07-17T20:03:53Z","timestamp":1405627433,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_TOgNSvWnKm"}
