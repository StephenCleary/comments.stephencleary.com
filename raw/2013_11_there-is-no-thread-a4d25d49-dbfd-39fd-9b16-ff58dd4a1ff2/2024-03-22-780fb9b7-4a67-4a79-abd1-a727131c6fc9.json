I\u0027ve included it in all my async intro discussions. And yet I have lost count how many times I\u0027ve been asked this question - several hundred times, at least. The most recent time was a couple weeks ago.\n\nWhen people are told that async/await does *not* create threads, then their next question is usually \u0022how does it work, then?\u0022 (i.e., how does actual work get done without threads). And answering that is the point of this post.\n\nSo, while you are correct in that this post is not strictly about the async/await keywords per se, it does address a common (still common!) point of confusion about how asynchronous code actually works.","date":"2024-03-22T12:06:52.6948011Z"}
