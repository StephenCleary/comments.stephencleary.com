I think the confusion about threads is some people think that concurrency is always done with threads. With respect to I/O, the reading or writing of bytes is done in the hardware, concurrently with the execution of your code. So yes two things are happening at once but the other thing isn't happening on a second thread.\r\n\r\nOthers might consider anything that causes the context to be swapped out to be a separate thread of execution. While these may not be threads in the strictest sense, they are context switches.","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"","date":"2016-12-10T05:46:49Z","timestamp":1481348809,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_yw7A34vbfk"}
