Their implementation is pretty much identical (they generally use overlapped I/O, IOCPs, etc); only the end notification is different. IAsyncResult is a pretty close match to OVERLAPPED, and uses a callback method to notify the application the operation is complete. Task is a more modern way to notify applications that operations are complete.","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"b0566718-e448-3753-8346-7b80be263f9e","date":"2015-09-15T11:52:39Z","timestamp":1442317959}
