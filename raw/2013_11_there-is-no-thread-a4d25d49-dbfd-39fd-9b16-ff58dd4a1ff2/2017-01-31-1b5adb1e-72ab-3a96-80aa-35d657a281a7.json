I also asked this on stack overflow and added some sample programs ([http://stackoverflow.com/q/...](http://stackoverflow.com/q/41952687/193414) \"http://stackoverflow.com/q/41952687/193414)\"). It looks as if there is a limit as to how many threads will be taken from the thread pool to execute the async task continuations. The answer I accepted indicated 1-2 threads per logical core and my tests showed it was more like 3. It also did not matter whether a single or multiple threads were used to start big batches of async IO operations - the threads still maxed out around the same numbers - off course this can also be due all the tasks have been synchronized when waiting for access to the file system, which was used to implement the async IO.","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"918fae56-7374-3f26-8e03-47fd4ea9005c","date":"2017-01-31T14:13:23Z","timestamp":1485872003,"authorUserId":"disqus:snielsson"}
