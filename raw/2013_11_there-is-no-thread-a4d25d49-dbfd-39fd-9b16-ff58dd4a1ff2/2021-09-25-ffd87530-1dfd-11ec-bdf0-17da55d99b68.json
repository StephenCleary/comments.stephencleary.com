Instead, it queues the continuation of that method onto the UI context, and the UI thread will resume executing that method when it gets around to it.\"\r\n\r\nfor this bit, if I understand correctly what you said, does that mean that the UI thread (main thread) is the one that going to resume executing, but when I check others (e.g. https://youtu.be/il9gl8MH17s) I see that there are a new thread that resume at the await keyword, while the main thread is still stuck doing others thing. \r\n\r\nIn the example above (youtube) you can see his example with the boiling water function, I see the main thread is still busy itself with a loop, the Boiling Water function have already resumed and finish on another thread\r\n\r\nCan you help me verify this bit ? Thank you in advance","date":"2021-09-25T12:42:09.977Z"}
