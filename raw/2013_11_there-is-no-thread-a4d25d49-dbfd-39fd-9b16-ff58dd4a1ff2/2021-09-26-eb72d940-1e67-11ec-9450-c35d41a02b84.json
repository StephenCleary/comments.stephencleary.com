So the SyncContext is the one that make sure the which thread resume the continuation.\r\n\r\nBut pardon my ignorance, then how can I determined or know that when a SyncContext exists? For example, am working with server side app, Web API, and from what I can see, it doesn't have an UI, so does that meant it doesn't have a SyncContext as well, result in a default SyncContext(ThreadPool) for all of is async await operations? \r\n\r\nAlso for this bit \"the continuation is scheduled to the UI thread's message processing queue. \" as I checked the your blog on SyncContext (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2011/february/msdn-magazine-parallel-computing-it-s-all-about-the-synchronizationcontext#the-concept-of-synchronizationcontext) , I thought that the continuation is queued on the context itself not on the thread right? or what you meant is that SyncContext in your example (UI context) is only have a single UI thread, so they mean the same thing ?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance","date":"2021-09-26T01:20:22.461Z"}
