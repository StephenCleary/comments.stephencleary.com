Very clarifying view over an obscure topic.  \r\nI know it's been a while but what exactly do you meant by:  \r\n\"The task has captured the UI context, so it does not resume the async method directly on the thread pool thread. Instead, it queues the continuation of that method onto the UI context, and the UI thread will resume executing that method when it gets around to it.\"  \r\nIs it that the very same thread that started the Task will be resumed to continue the work or is it a new (different) thread that will be randomly picked to continue? Or I am not quite getting it how this context is manged.  \r\nMany thanks!","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"","date":"2016-09-08T08:21:43Z","timestamp":1473322903,"authorUserId":""}
