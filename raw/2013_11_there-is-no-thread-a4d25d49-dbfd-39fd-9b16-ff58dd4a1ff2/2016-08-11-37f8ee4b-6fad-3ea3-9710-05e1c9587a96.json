Aside from Overlapped and IOCompletionCallback using raw NativeOverlapped pointers,each call requires it's own TaskCompletionSource and a unique managed delegate, which seems like it's a bit heavy for handling IO completion.\r\n\r\nI just thought it was strange that MS decided not to create a better managed interface, given how ubiquitous overlapped IO ends up being under the hood. It's not \"hard\" to do, but the intricacies of overlapped IO seem sufficient to warrant a bit more assistance on the developer side.\r\n\r\nI hadn't thought to extend Overlapped itself. I can see it helping if I don't have to create a new delegate for each call. Certainly something to think about. Thank you.","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"eda8e557-9f29-3fcc-b80d-5c65d3b21224","date":"2016-08-11T23:16:52Z","timestamp":1470957412,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_ClNCtMIgGo"}
