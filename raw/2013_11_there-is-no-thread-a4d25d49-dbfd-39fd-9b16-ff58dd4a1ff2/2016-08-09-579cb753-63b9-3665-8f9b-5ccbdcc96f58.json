It definitely helped me understand tasks better.\r\n\r\nI recently have done some work that led me to a question about the chart you've got. Why aren't there better mechanisms for turning Overlapped IO calls into tasks? I managed to do it by closing over a TaskCompletionSource, but it seems strange that I have to do that when the basic concept of the async-await style task and overlapped IO seem so similar.","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"","date":"2016-08-09T20:45:47Z","timestamp":1470775547,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_ClNCtMIgGo"}
