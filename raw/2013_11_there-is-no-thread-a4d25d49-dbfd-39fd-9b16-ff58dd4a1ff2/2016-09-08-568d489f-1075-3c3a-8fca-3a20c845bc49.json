Not because tasks *always* do this, but because the UI context is tied to a specific thread.\r\n\r\nIf you run an async method on the thread pool, then the thread pool context is used (technically, there is no context captured, and the thread pool context is used if there is none). In that case, when the async method resumed, it would run on a thread pool thread, which may or may not be the same thread it started on.","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"df732c96-74c6-3893-9701-0391b60436b6","date":"2016-09-08T13:31:11Z","timestamp":1473341471}
