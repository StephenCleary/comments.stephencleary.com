Continuations of your own code almost always happen at a higher level, and are executed by regular worker threads.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing really wrong with `Task.WhenAll`. It would use a bit more memory to do multiple asynchronous operations at once, but that would almost certainly be more than compensated for by reducing how long requests are outstanding. So I would expect code using `Task.WhenAll` to be more scalable, generally speaking.","date":"2021-06-29T23:22:53.446Z"}
