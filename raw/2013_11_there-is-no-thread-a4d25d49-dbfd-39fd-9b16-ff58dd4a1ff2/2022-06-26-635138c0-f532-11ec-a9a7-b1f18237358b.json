I believe what confuses most people is the difference between a thread being suspended and a thread being blocked!...can you elaborate more on this statement....\r\n\r\n\"which returns an incomplete task to the button click event handler, which suspends the async method, and the UI thread continues executing.\"\r\n\r\nA- isn't the event handler being executed within the UI thread?\r\nB- how can the UI thread \"continue executing\" while the event handler is waiting for the task to complete (await)\r\n\r\nanother question \r\n\r\nisn't it true that regardless if the event handler await the task or try to access Task.Result (which block) , the event handle wont return a result back to the browser until the entire handler call run, and in that regards, what exactly is the value of async await?","date":"2022-06-26T09:28:50.646Z"}
