Behind the scenes, the \"callback\" is scheduled on thread pool and eventually called.\r\n\r\nIf you do something that block on that callback, you're going to consume all threads on the thread pool (supposing there's a lot of tcp connections doing ReadAsync simultaneously).\r\n\r\nBut the ReadAsync will continue to be issued as the thread pool is not being used to send that command to the network driver.","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"0f4118e4-3ef4-305a-8b7f-ec2c77155ca3","date":"2017-01-25T12:02:38Z","timestamp":1485345758,"authorUserId":"disqus:rafaelnicoletti"}
