However, one I/O thread can handle any number of IOCP notifications. The thread pool will inject I/O threads if they get bogged down, but a single I/O thread can handle a *huge* amount of I/O. The IOCP will always exist for an application - it's used quite a bit internally by the BCL.\r\n\r\nSo, you can think of it like this: the BCL already has an I/O thread(s), and by using IOCP you're reusing the same thread(s) instead of blocking another one.","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"16f3f266-623d-3eb0-8b9b-be0a9f347dc4","date":"2014-12-02T21:38:15Z","timestamp":1417556295}
