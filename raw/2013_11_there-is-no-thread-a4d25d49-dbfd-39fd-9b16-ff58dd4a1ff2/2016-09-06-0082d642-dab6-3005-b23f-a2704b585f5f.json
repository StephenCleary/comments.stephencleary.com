The device driver just has 4 (*) pieces of code: Load/Unload, I/O API, DPC and ISR - In the I/O request, the data is stored in RAM and then even without DMA, the DPC sends it out or receives it when queued by the ISR. (*) giant bunch of other stuff involving Power States does not apply to discussion.","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"e9bd4d27-c6ca-3b1d-bd5c-03f537cda357","date":"2016-09-06T03:05:19Z","timestamp":1473131119}
