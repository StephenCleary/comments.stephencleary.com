I have an extension of this question. Lets say we have a call chain of 10 methods that all return a Task of some form. In each method an await is done to another async method. However all of these methods are simply synchronous operations that perform basic logic. If there is not a Task.Run in any of the methods will the entire call chain execute synchronously? Would this just then be a \"phantom\" async method that you are calling?","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"82a4ab2b-b9bb-3c6f-b048-ae7ee169f98f","date":"2015-03-12T12:43:07Z","timestamp":1426164187}
