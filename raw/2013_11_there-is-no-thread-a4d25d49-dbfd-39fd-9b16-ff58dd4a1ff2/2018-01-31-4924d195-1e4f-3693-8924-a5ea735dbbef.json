This is true regardless of the number of cores.\r\n\r\nWhen synchronously blocking, the thread is in a suspended state and not scheduled onto a CPU. Once the hardware interrupts, it completes the (asynchronous) I/O, which then moves the thread to a ready state, so it will then be scheduled.","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"50443b21-769f-3b9e-99f3-b4cbfd9d449a","date":"2018-01-31T00:34:59Z","timestamp":1517358899}
