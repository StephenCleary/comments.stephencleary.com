I still have one doubt:  \r\n\r\n\"Since the library/BCL is using the standard P/Invoke overlapped I/O system, it has already registered the handle with the I/O Completion Port (IOCP), which is part of the thread pool. So an I/O thread pool thread is borrowed briefly to execute the APC, which notifies the task that it's complete.\"  \r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by an I/O thread pool thread, you mean one of the threads that are registered in the I/O completion port?
