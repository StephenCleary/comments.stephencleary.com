Do you think it is possible to write a single threaded program with async behavior? By single thread I mean, not involving even the threadpool IO thread.   \r\nFrom your article I understand that this might not be possible for an IO operation but can't a single thread's time be sliced into mutiple tasks so that client \"feels\" that it is async?  \r\nSee my question here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45086555/writing-async-program-with-single-thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45086555/writing-async-program-with-single-thread)  \r\nThanks for your time btw.","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"b6c5c522-b6ed-3eec-8be5-6c9f533fa71a","date":"2017-07-14T03:29:20Z","timestamp":1500002960}
