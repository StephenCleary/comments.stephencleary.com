I have observed that behavior in the past, but it\u0027s usually avoided because the APC runs on an I/O thread pool thread (part of the IOCP), and user code should be run on a worker thread pool thread. So usually there\u0027s a pass-off from the APC to the worker thread pool before your code is actually invoked.\n\nThe DPC communicates to the IOCP *by* completing the IRP. That IRP is associated with the IOCP, and by completing the IRP, the DPC has done all it needs to do.","date":"2024-03-22T12:17:53.1721260Z"}
