However, this is extremely rare, especially since I/O completion port threads are different than CPU thread pool threads (the ThreadPool class is really two thread pools in one).","postId":"2013_11_there-is-no-thread-a4d25d49-dbfd-39fd-9b16-ff58dd4a1ff2","replyTo":"13b84301-cb0b-31f3-8b3c-79e2088f1ef1","date":"2014-09-05T11:52:20Z","timestamp":1409917940,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
