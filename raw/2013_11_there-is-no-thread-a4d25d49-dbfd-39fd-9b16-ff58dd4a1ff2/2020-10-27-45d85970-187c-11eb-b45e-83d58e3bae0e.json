The part I talk about in this article is the IOCP side, which has a number of \"I/O threads\" processing that IOCP. The part that *most* articles talk about is the worker side, which has a number of \"worker threads\" just doing whatever is queued to the thread pool. So all the work-stealing queues and things like that are all on the worker side of the thread pool.\r\n\r\nHopefully that clears it up. Those other articles aren't *wrong;* it's just that most people think about the worker thread pool when talking about \"the thread pool\", and this article deals with the *other* side of the thread pool - the I/O thread side.","date":"2020-10-27T17:45:59.493Z"}
