That is the misleading.\r\n\r\nInstead, you can say: \"It depends\":\r\n- If the operation is IO: no thread created - the system supports real async operation.\r\n- If the operation is CPU: new thread must be created (via Task.Run) - it's actually a async wrapper for sync operation. But you're still await on an operation.","date":"2019-04-02T01:30:41.256Z"}
