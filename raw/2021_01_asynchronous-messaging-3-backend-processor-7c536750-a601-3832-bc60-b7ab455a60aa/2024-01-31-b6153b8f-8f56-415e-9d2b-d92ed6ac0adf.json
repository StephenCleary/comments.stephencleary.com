I also realize you mention to be wary about using the BackgroundService directly and instead opt for implementing the IHostedService, Am I interpreting this right that information only applies to long running services that are embedded as part of your web application? Otherwise it is ok to implement the logic directly in the class that extends the BackgroundService class.","date":"2024-01-31T17:19:56.7206604Z"}
