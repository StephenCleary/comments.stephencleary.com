To check it more frequently is great way to do, but suppose that I call .dll or outside library( do a thing that cost very long time and I can't expect ) in DoWork of backgroundworker, in this situation it's useless to check token frequently, it still wait the job to be finish. I try to make my code as safe as possible, so even I got a solution from website( Thread.Abort ) , I still try to find a better way to deal with this problem. What could I do ?
