In your example, you have code in the method both before and after the call to Task.Run, so it's fine. What I don't recommend is if, say, you moved the call to Task.Run within the someClass.LongRunningFunction and tried to make it async that way.\r\n\r\nI have another blog post where I (hopefully) am more clear: [http://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/11/taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use.html](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/11/taskrun-etiquette-examples-dont-use.html)\r\n\r\nSo, your code as it is, is just what I would recommend. The guideline is better stated as \"don't use Task.Run to *implement* a method; use Task.Run to *call* a method\".","postId":"2013_09_taskrun-vs-backgroundworker-conclusion-05b51fdb-ee16-3d4a-9ffb-c5dc5423ce8f","replyTo":"d827a64c-2dce-3d51-8e9d-df0ded65c52d","date":"2014-12-12T14:06:43Z","timestamp":1418393203}
