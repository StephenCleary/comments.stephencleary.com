And I appreciate your blog that helps me a lot. Recently I got an issue , I assume that the background thread is running of long time work, HOW COULD I STOP THE THREAD IMMEDIATELY ? I tried to use backgroundworker & Task , when I triggered cancellation process,they still wait current work to be finished, after that they stop, couldn't I just force them to stop ? Is any way to solve this problem?
