But, i follow thru your code and its really helpful. I have a question related to backgroundworker and task.  \r\nI have a scenario where i need to call a backgroundworker and in-turns, the bgworker will call Task.Run() to fire multiple tasks. The reason i need to use Backgroundworker is, i need to Enqueue and dequeue the job and handle sequentially one after other job. but, the job itself will be run in multiple threads (called by Task.StartNew(runjob)). Can you correct me if this approach is wrong? if so, how can i avoid bgworker and call Tasks inside tasks. Thanks you.","postId":"2013_09_taskrun-vs-backgroundworker-conclusion-05b51fdb-ee16-3d4a-9ffb-c5dc5423ce8f","replyTo":"","date":"2016-08-30T18:34:21Z","timestamp":1472582061}
