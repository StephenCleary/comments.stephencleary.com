I share Stephen's dislike of `Task.Run`, so I ended up using the `await Task.Yield` approach. Fortunately I already had a bit of framework wrapped around `BackgroundService` so it was a one line code change to add this behavior to all of my background services, rather than having to remember to add to each one. Thanks for the link to the github issue; I've added my vote.","date":"2020-08-25T14:56:09.320Z"}
