Specifically, think about what that token would do.\n\nWhat most developers _think_ that token does and what it _actually_ does are two different things. Most developers think that the token would cancel the work done by \u0060Task.Run\u0060. But that\u0027s not what happens; that token only cancels the _scheduling_ of the work done by \u0060Task.Run\u0060. And the scheduling happens immediately, when the token is not cancelled (unless the host immediately shut down for some reason).\n\nSo, passing the token will do absolutely nothing other than mislead other developers.\n\nI\u0027m aware that there are some \u0022helpful\u0022 diagnostic systems that suggest you should pass the token. They are wrong, IMO.","date":"2023-06-28T11:53:56.6259218Z"}
