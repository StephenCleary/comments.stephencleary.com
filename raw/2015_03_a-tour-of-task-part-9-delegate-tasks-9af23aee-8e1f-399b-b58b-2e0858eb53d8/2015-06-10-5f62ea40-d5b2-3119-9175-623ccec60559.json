For example, if you have a library method that has *both* asynchronous and CPU-bound portions, a UI-based consumer may elect to use Task.Run. Another example is to completely remove context, e.g., if you're doing an early return on ASP.NET (which is dangerous, but sadly common).\r\n\r\nNormally, yes, you would just invoke the async method directly.
