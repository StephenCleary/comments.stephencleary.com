Awesome material.\r\n\r\nAbout the subject of passing CancellationToken to Task.Run\r\nEven if there is a lot of Tasks being created in a System (many different calls to Task.Run at the same time), it doesn't bring that much of a benefit? \r\n\r\nIf a Task is not running yet the CancellationToken doesn't cancel it?  \r\nOr what matters is the Status = Scheduled? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance :D","date":"2019-02-12T22:54:45.075Z"}
