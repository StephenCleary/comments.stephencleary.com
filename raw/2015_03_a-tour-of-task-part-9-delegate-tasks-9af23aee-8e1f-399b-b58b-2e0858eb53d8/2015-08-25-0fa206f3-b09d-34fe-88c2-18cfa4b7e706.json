This is a hack, just like any way of executing \"sync over async\". I'd recommend at least changing it to Task.Run().Wait() for cleanliness. It is, of course, still a hack, but as long as BaseClass forces a poor design, you don't have a choice.","postId":"2015_03_a-tour-of-task-part-9-delegate-tasks-9af23aee-8e1f-399b-b58b-2e0858eb53d8","replyTo":"72ada546-72b4-36df-bc7f-3b4e0586f976","date":"2015-08-25T11:17:36Z","timestamp":1440501456}
