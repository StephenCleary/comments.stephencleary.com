All are async from the bottom.   \r\nSo the real point how to execute in parallel. The await mode of execution always waits for the first to complete.  \r\nSo this causes the second await to be queued. How can we run both of them same time?  \r\nDoes this means that the scheduling of these task on the Task scheduler and based on the availablity of thread it may or maynot run in parallel?   \r\nIf this is the case then there is very less change of parallelism in I/o bound operations?\r\n\r\nSecondly When we run the Task.Run code if we are unable to cancel the task in the realtime then it really creates a over head of executing unwanted code?  \r\nRegards","postId":"2015_03_a-tour-of-task-part-9-delegate-tasks-9af23aee-8e1f-399b-b58b-2e0858eb53d8","replyTo":"","date":"2015-03-23T09:02:00Z","timestamp":1427101320,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_weoHk4DDGw"}
