This topic is hard for me to wrap my head around. I would like to ask you if there is a good example (simple project) that demonstrates this. I have a project that I am working on and I feel the thread is being blocked causing the main application to crash.\r\n\r\nBasically, I need the \"waitforinput\" to be async task... at least that is what I think needs to happen.\r\n\r\nNote: the external program I did not create and have no access to source code.\r\n\r\nI tried thread.sleep() and other things but it did not allow the program back access to do what it needs to do. If that makes any sense.\r\n\r\nThe best example I can give inside a blog would be:\r\n\r\nclass program  \r\n{\r\n\r\n static void main() //This main is executed by an external program   \r\n {  \r\n //Stuff//  \r\n waitforinput();  \r\n }  \r\n public void waitforinput()  \r\n {\r\n\r\n While(true); // blocks the external program from running  \r\n }\r\n\r\n}","postId":"2014_02_synchronous-and-asynchronous-delegate-da774236-3c77-3bd8-9d4d-1e1e1260e7e5","replyTo":"","date":"2015-10-30T23:24:35Z","timestamp":1446247475,"authorUserId":""}
