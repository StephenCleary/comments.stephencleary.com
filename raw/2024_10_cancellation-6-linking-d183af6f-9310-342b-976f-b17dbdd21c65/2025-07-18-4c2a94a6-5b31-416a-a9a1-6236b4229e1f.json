Many times Microsoft example code is actually an example of \u0022how to call this API\u0022 and not an example of \u0022how you should structure your code\u0022. I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s a deliberate decision or more of an oversight.\n\nMost (all?) MS .NET docs are open-source these days. You can suggest changes whenever you want!  MS encourages contributions; you can get started on most pages by opening the three-dot dropdown on the upper-right of most articles, and selecting Edit. That\u0027ll drop you into GitHub, where you can fork and create a PR.","date":"2025-07-18T15:00:49.0857100Z"}
