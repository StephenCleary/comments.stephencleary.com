If I pass the token from it to various functions in my application, it makes it easy to abort operations fast and gracefully if I need to shut down the application. \n\nBut that token over a long time accretes references which keep increasing until the LOH grows irreversibly.\n\nTherefore,  I use an inner token (linked) which is disposed more frequently. \n\nDoes this seem reasonable?\n\n","date":"2025-01-26T03:35:38.0492260Z"}
