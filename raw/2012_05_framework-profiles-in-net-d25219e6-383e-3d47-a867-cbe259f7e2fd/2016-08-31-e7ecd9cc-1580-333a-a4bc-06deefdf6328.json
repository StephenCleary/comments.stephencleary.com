I found it just now.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the portwble TFM is in the imports. Imports are a way of telling netcore that you want to be able to use libraries for that framework. Imports are dangerous because if a portable library tries to use something in that framework that is not on the machine running your app, it will fail. However, imports are also necessary for a while, until library developers all support netcore.","postId":"2012_05_framework-profiles-in-net-d25219e6-383e-3d47-a867-cbe259f7e2fd","replyTo":"d49779ef-c090-3b73-9c65-698b30ed84d2","date":"2016-08-31T01:22:26Z","timestamp":1472606546}
