This dates back to .NET 1.0.  \r\n\r\nWith .NET 2.0, Microsoft went through and changed all that. They still implement the IDisposable pattern just in case anyone was depending on it, but internally they split everything into \"unmanaged resource owners\" and \"managed resource owners\".  \r\n\r\nWhen I started writing about IDisposable, I was actually just documenting what Microsoft's actual practice was rather than their official recommendation (except for unsealed disposables).","postId":"2009_08_third-rule-of-implementing-idisposable-832d2031-f442-3138-9c21-3930cda700c7","replyTo":"","date":"2012-04-14T02:28:23Z","timestamp":1334370503,"authorUserId":""}
