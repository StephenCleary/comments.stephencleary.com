They can use UNC paths, but you have to do that kind of translation in an application running in the user's desktop. If you have a tray or background application translate the network drive to a UNC path, then it can pass the UNC path to the Win32 service. But the service itself cannot do that translation.","postId":"2009_10_windows-services-and-network-5f8417be-0b12-3558-9de2-9090dbdc8315","replyTo":"","date":"2013-08-14T06:06:01Z","timestamp":1376460361}
