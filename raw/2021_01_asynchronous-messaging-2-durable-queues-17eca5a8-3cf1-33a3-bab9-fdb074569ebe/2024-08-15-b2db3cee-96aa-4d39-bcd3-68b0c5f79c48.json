A software must be able to survive an unexpected crash (including unmanaged shutdowns) without problems for its data consistency.\n\nI\u0027m in complete agreement. I was using \u0022shutdowns\u0022 here in a broad sense, including both managed and unmanaged shutdowns.\n\n\u003E And a periodic recycle isn\u0027t a good solution at all.\n\nAgain, I agree. The point of that section was not to _encourage_ patching over memory leaks; the point was that most hosting systems _by default_ will do regular shutdowns. In my experience, this is something most developers are not aware of.\n\n\u003E So you\u0027re talking about a \u0022delayed response\u0022, a queue and the code to handle it.\n\nI specifically (and deliberately) use the term \u0022durable queue\u0022, because if you just say \u0022queue\u0022, then the vast majority of developers think \u0060Queue\u003CT\u003E\u0060 (with a handful of more senior developers thinking \u0060ConcurrentQueue\u003CT\u003E\u0060). Almost none of them think Azure Queue by default. At least not yet.","date":"2024-08-15T08:42:50.1854236Z"}
