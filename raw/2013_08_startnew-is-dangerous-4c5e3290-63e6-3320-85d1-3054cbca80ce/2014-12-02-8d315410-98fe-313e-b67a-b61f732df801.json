The thread still does count towards the thread pool limit and is used as part of the pool. They are not promoted to LongRunning.\r\n\r\nBut still, every single time I've seen the LongRunning flag used, it has been used incorrectly. First, LongRunning is only a hint - it does not mean that the delegate will execute on a dedicated thread, or that it will not count towards the thread pool limit - it just happens to be that way in the current implementation. To quote Stephen Toub, \"You'd typically only use LongRunning if you found through performance testing that not using it was causing long delays in the processing of other work.\"","postId":"2013_08_startnew-is-dangerous-4c5e3290-63e6-3320-85d1-3054cbca80ce","replyTo":"35b829a3-fa7e-314f-988d-aeda3b3d8b1a","date":"2014-12-02T14:58:59Z","timestamp":1417532339,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
