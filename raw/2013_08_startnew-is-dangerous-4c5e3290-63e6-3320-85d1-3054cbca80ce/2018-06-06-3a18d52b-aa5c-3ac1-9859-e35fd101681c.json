E.g. a WCF operation. I want to process my incoming requests in separate threads so I start a new task using Task.Factory.Startnew. The advantage I see here is that I pass the state object to my worker methods using StartNew to avoid closures and allocations.\r\n\r\nWhat is your opinion here?","postId":"2013_08_startnew-is-dangerous-4c5e3290-63e6-3320-85d1-3054cbca80ce","replyTo":"","date":"2018-06-06T04:06:15Z","timestamp":1528257975}
