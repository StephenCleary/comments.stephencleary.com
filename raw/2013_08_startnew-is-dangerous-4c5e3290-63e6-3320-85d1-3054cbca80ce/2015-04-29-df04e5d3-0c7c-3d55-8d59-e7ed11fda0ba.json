Task.Factory.StartNew is certainly not a good approach if you have synchronous code to run.\r\n\r\nIf you have a synchronous implementation of a method that returns a task, then you should use Task.FromResult.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly true for ASP.NET; there should almost never be a need to call Task.Run (or even worse, StartNew), certainly not in a MediaTypeFormatter class.","postId":"2013_08_startnew-is-dangerous-4c5e3290-63e6-3320-85d1-3054cbca80ce","replyTo":"09a1b606-718c-3b21-92d9-de04b312b2fe","date":"2015-04-29T12:40:40Z","timestamp":1430311240}
