But you can derive from BufferedMediaTypeFormatter, which has no such requirement.\r\n\r\nAm I analyzing this right? Thanks for this great technical post.","postId":"2013_08_startnew-is-dangerous-4c5e3290-63e6-3320-85d1-3054cbca80ce","replyTo":"","date":"2015-04-29T12:01:43Z","timestamp":1430308903,"authorUserId":"disqus:cg_spaceshot"}
