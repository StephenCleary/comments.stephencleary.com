What is the best way? I'm using StartNew going 'AttachedToParent' as TaskCreationOptions parameter but can not get it to work as it should...\r\n\r\nYou see, each task executes the same procedure (with different parameters) to add objects to a list of 'BodyPaq'. Within each object 'BodyPaq' there is a price list. Each task should create a BodyPaq with certain prices.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that using StartNew as I do, are mixed in the same 'BodyPaq' prices that are generated by one and another task. I don't know if I'm explaining myself well.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to split a task asynchronously?","postId":"2013_08_startnew-is-dangerous-4c5e3290-63e6-3320-85d1-3054cbca80ce","replyTo":"","date":"2014-11-07T11:41:07Z","timestamp":1415360467,"authorUserId":"disqus:santicscs"}
