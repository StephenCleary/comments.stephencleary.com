StartNew (or Run) will consume one extra thread per request.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, I'd use asynchronous code for the WebAPI calls, and wrap them in a Task.WhenAll and then block on that. That way you're only consuming one extra thread for all of the requests combined.\r\n\r\nThat said, if you're fine consuming extra threads, then there isn't a need to change the current code.","postId":"2013_08_startnew-is-dangerous-4c5e3290-63e6-3320-85d1-3054cbca80ce","replyTo":"70b2ab7b-0014-3853-aef8-67991e17a293","date":"2017-08-25T21:16:18Z","timestamp":1503695778}
