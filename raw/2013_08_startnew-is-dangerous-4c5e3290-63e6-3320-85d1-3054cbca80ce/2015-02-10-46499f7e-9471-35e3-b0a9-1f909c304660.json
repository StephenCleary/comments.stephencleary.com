Note that the computation in that code is done by A(), which is not explicitly scheduled to the UI thread. The first time the code is called, StartNew schedules A() to a thread pool thread (as the developer expected); the second time, StartNew implicitly schedules A() to the UI thread. This is not a contrived example; I've seen developers from multiple companies make this mistake many times.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, Task.Run does not actually use Task.Factory.StartNew (you can verify this yourself with the reference source: [http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/threading/Tasks/Task.cs,89fc01f3bb88eed9](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/threading/Tasks/Task.cs,89fc01f3bb88eed9) ). The point that Stephen Toub is making is that Task.Run is *similar* to using Task.Factory.StartNew (but with safer default behavior).\r\n\r\nAnd the central point of both his post and this one is the same: Task.Run is better than Task.Factory.StartNew.","postId":"2013_08_startnew-is-dangerous-4c5e3290-63e6-3320-85d1-3054cbca80ce","replyTo":"67b267ac-b4fe-395f-8f24-aa0c152954b9","date":"2015-02-10T21:40:43Z","timestamp":1423604443}
