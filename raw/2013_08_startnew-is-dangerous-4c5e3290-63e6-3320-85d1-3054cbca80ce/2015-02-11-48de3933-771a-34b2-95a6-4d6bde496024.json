Sorry for being literal; I do try on my blog to be literally correct without going into too many details, but I guess it went too far this time. Regarding dangerousness, I still disagree; StartNew is more dangerous because it has dangerous default values. I believe they both eventually simplify down to ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem (or UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem), but I'd never recommend that method either.\r\n\r\n2. Compute() is not the method that does CPU work; it's just the \"managing\" method responsible for scheduling the work and handling UI updates. A() is the method that actually does the CPU work. A() is not explicitly scheduled on the UI thread.","postId":"2013_08_startnew-is-dangerous-4c5e3290-63e6-3320-85d1-3054cbca80ce","replyTo":"c7a8aa0b-ac89-35ef-adaf-21f8bdf83573","date":"2015-02-11T18:16:31Z","timestamp":1423678591}
