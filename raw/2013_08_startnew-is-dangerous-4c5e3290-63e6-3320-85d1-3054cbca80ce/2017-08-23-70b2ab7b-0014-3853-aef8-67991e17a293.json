So have implemented the Task for calling all the API in parallel. and To harvest the result - as the Task got started at the time of calling I have used TaskGroupPreferenceList.GetAwaiter().GetResult(); . Now i got confused that whether i did right or wrong.\r\n\r\nAs per you blog I should use Task.Run () with all the Sync methods and club all the task with WHENALL() and then get the result by using T1.Result,   \r\nCan you please have a look. and I do not want to use async because the i have to modify lots of code as its already in production. I am using this to make faster call to the webAPI.","postId":"2013_08_startnew-is-dangerous-4c5e3290-63e6-3320-85d1-3054cbca80ce","replyTo":"9c99d7ce-0469-3e3e-ace3-72356d9036a1","date":"2017-08-23T09:51:36Z","timestamp":1503481896,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_sISt9TbOob"}
