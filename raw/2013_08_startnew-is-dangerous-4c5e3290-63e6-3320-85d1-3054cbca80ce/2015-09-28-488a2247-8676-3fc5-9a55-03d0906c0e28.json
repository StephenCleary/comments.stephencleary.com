It's just my own preference is to use something that's officially part of the BCL and has thus gone through extra reviews, testing, performance analysis, etc.\r\n\r\nIn this case (using a custom TaskScheduler), I'd recommend constructing your own TaskFactory and using its StartNew. There's nothing wrong with using TaskFactory.StartNew; this blog post is only about the dangers inherent in Task.Factory.StartNew. And yes, that's a tricky distinction! :)","postId":"2013_08_startnew-is-dangerous-4c5e3290-63e6-3320-85d1-3054cbca80ce","replyTo":"d1599327-48cf-346f-912c-bcce8716342d","date":"2015-09-28T16:39:43Z","timestamp":1443458383}
