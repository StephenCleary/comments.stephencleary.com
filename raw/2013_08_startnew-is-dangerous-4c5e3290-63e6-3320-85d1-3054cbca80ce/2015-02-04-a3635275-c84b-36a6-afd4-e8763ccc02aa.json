Why type out \"Task.Factory.StartNew(A, CancellationToken.None, TaskCreationOptions.DenyChildAttach, TaskScheduler.Default);\" (or even \"Task.Factory.StartNew(A);\") when you can do the same thing with \"Task.Run(() => A());\". Task.Run doesn't just have safer defaults; it's also shorter and more readable.","postId":"2013_08_startnew-is-dangerous-4c5e3290-63e6-3320-85d1-3054cbca80ce","replyTo":"63b8108d-1ff1-3d1c-94ff-f7002764b530","date":"2015-02-04T13:31:52Z","timestamp":1423056712}
