It's a Xamarin Android application in VS2017, The client ask me to implement an option when you validate a process (Ex. an inventory)  and there isn't network available, simulate the validation process (store in the local db all the information needed to call the WS later when the network back).  When you validate the inventory we call a WS and wait for the answer in order to log and delete the row treated from the db . \r\nI made an IntentService with an alarm manager that turn every 15 min, to check if there is/are something in the table with status IsSended = false.  Then I have a foreach of items and inside of it, an \"await\" from a task<bool> with the answer from the WS if it was ok or not.  It works fine i think so, but I have to wait for the WebSservice answer of the one item to starts the next call.  I asked to myself if it isn't better to have some parallelism, maybe a Task.Factory with a task responsable of each item and they are independent (I never used before).  What do you think ? Thanks in advance and have a good day.","date":"2018-11-21T10:24:50.073Z"}
