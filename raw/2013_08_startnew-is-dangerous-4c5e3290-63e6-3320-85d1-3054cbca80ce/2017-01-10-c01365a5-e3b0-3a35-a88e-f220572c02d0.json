There's no benefit to using StartNew even in that case, though - Task.Run is shorter and has better defaults for the other arguments.\r\n\r\nIn production code, you would not want to use parallelism on a public-facing server; it could easily kill your scalability. This is true whether it's StartNew or Task.Run.","postId":"2013_08_startnew-is-dangerous-4c5e3290-63e6-3320-85d1-3054cbca80ce","replyTo":"5b8e4a90-26e5-34d0-a936-28e7f8cf481d","date":"2017-01-10T14:13:12Z","timestamp":1484057592}
