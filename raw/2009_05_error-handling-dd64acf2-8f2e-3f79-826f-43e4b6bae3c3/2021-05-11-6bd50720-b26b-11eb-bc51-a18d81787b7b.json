I have a number of embedded controllers that communicate with a TCP 'Server' through an unmanaged switch.  In this sense, each controller is the server side of a TCP/IP connection and the 'server' is the client side.  This server runs on a fanless Windows 10 box that has two NICs.  The second NIC is used to allow multiple 'clients' to connect to the server on a separate IP subnet.  These clients run on Windows 10 PC's (laptops and desktops).  The client is an MFC Dialog based GUI.  So, everything is up and running until I disconnect the cable between the switch and the server.  At that point the CLIENT sends a FIN packet to the server.  This is on the other NIC!  I have not been able to figure out why this would happen.  Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAaron","date":"2021-05-11T15:13:21.505Z"}
