The behavior I've observed on Windows is that it will send RST packets on behalf of clients that have had their cable disconnected from the server-side. But that was many years ago and I believe the TCP/IP stack has been rewritten since then.\r\n\r\nIf you're sure you're seeing FIN packets on connections that shouldn't have been affected by the unplug, then I'd first ensure that those server sockets are bound to the correct specific IP. If it still happens, I guess contacting Microsoft support would be the next step.\r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\n\r\n-Steve","date":"2021-05-11T16:44:49.829Z"}
