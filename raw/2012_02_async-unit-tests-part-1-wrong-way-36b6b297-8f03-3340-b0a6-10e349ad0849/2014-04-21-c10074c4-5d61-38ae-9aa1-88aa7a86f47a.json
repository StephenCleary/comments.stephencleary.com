I read that blog post about a year ago.  \r\n\r\nThere are certain types of code such as domain objects and business rules that are very amenable to tests and are ideal for test-driven development. I would go so far as to say that there are entire applications (probably a majority of applications) that can be developed using TDD.  \r\n\r\nHowever, there are also other types of code such as low-level synchronization libraries that cannot be fully developed using test-driven development; at some point a deep understanding of race conditions and other multithreading concerns *must* guide the code development. TDD alone and unguided would result in subtle bugs.","postId":"2012_02_async-unit-tests-part-1-wrong-way-36b6b297-8f03-3340-b0a6-10e349ad0849","replyTo":"","date":"2014-04-21T05:52:14Z","timestamp":1398059534,"authorUserId":""}
