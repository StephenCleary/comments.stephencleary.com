This is because simple substring matching is insufficient. Consider not only CDATA, but also comments and child nodes with the same name.  \r\n\r\nYou actually have to end up writing a partial XML parser, which is made more complex by having to accept partial input (i.e., a SAX-style parser rather than a DOM-style parser). It's a lot easier to just wrap it with message framing.","postId":"2009_07_xml-over-tcpip-ef705309-219f-33bf-b68b-bc672c257e4c","replyTo":"","date":"2011-01-03T09:11:16Z","timestamp":1294045876}
