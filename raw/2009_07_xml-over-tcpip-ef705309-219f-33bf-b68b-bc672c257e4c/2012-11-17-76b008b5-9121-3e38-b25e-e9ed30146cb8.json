In addition, some request types result in that notification messages are sent from server to client. These notifications occur at inpredictable times. Is it possible that a notification message interferes with a request message if they are sent at exactly the same timestamp (using the same socket)? Could this be the reason that I sometimes observe that mutilated messages are received by the client?
