If a class doesn't implement IDisposable, you might need to implement IDisposable -- or you might have managed resources like String or List that don't implement IDisposable but are managed nonetheless. So if you have one of these you're not sure about, but which has no IDisposable implementation (like, say, Dictionary), how do you tell which situation applies and whether you need an IDisposable implementation (and/or a finalizer)?","postId":"2009_08_first-rule-of-implementing-idisposable-8d02ff03-9b62-39b3-b718-1c114cd38394","replyTo":"","date":"2013-06-21T17:49:16Z","timestamp":1371836956}
