I  would like to get your clarification on the doubt which I have.\nMy Application has 3 layers Data , Domain, Host .\nSuppose in data layer I have a class A which owns a member field  of Class B(this class already implements IDisposable) , so for sure I need to Implement IDisposable in Class A as well because of Rule #1\n\nNow I am referencing this class A to Domain layer and domain class in turn is referred by Host class.\n\nDO I need to implement IDisposable in Domain and Host as well , provided I have not used any using(A a=new A()){}  type of things . dependency of A is injected into DOmain class via IoC container.\nI think Yes reading your blog. Please confirm . it would be a great help . Thanks :) ","date":"2023-02-22T19:06:13.6534571Z"}
