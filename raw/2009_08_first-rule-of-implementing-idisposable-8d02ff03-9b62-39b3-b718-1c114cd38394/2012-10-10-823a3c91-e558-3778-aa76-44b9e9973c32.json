You came to the conclusion that the class had no managed and no unmanaged resources... what does it have then? I know MSDN refers to IDisposable members as \"managed\" resources in covering the Dispose(bool disposing) pattern, but this is inaccurate. IDisposable members MAY live in managed memory but all we know about them is they have further *unmanaged* resources so they need Dispose() themselves.  \r\n\r\nA string and a List are managed resources, they live in managed memory and are collected by GC.
