Grate work, thanks.  \r\nIn teh doc, it says, that various methods can not be initiated from a free-threading model. Does this mean that the library can not be used in a background thread or windows service?  \r\nMost of my applications does not have a UI, so I am going to use the library in .NET DLLs, would this be ok. Any help is appriciated. Thanks again.  \r\n\r\nRegards  \r\nSam","postId":"2009_01_announcing-release-of-nitoasync-9749f435-6a79-35e6-811e-4ea59bfb7743","replyTo":"","date":"2009-08-07T04:36:12Z","timestamp":1249619772,"authorUserId":""}
