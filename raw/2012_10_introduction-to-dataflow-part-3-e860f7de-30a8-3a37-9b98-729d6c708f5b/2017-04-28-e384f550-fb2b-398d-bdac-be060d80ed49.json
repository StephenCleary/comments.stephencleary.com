I've only seen meshes get up to about a dozen in the most complex cases.\r\n\r\nYour problem sounds like the opposite: you need tens of thousands of nodes, through which very little data will pass. I conclude that TPL Dataflow is probably not the right tool for your needs.","postId":"2012_10_introduction-to-dataflow-part-3-e860f7de-30a8-3a37-9b98-729d6c708f5b","replyTo":"ba46be1b-5d99-336f-a29d-0c98ee6ee3fe","date":"2017-04-28T17:51:27Z","timestamp":1493401887}
