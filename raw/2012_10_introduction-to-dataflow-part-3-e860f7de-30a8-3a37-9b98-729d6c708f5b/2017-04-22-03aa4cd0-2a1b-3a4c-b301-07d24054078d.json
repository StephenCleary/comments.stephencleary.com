The nodes with \"op\" are operational blocks, the ones with no text - input nodes. Each operational node is represented by custom block. The problem is that when I create a graph in the figure with 256 x 256 nodes, it consumes a lot of memory and I get OutOfMemoryException, although I still have RAM.   \r\nDo you know any restrictions about the number of the blocks?\r\n\r\n [https://uploads.disquscdn.c...](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f3ed1a961150a4ae7c09b4877a3d009e0ef67ddec886b92f71503d6ebc40eb.png \"https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f3ed1a961150a4ae7c09b4877a3d009e0ef67ddec886b92f71503d6ebc40eb.png\")","postId":"2012_10_introduction-to-dataflow-part-3-e860f7de-30a8-3a37-9b98-729d6c708f5b","replyTo":"","date":"2017-04-22T14:52:03Z","timestamp":1492872723,"authorUserId":"disqus:meryumer"}
