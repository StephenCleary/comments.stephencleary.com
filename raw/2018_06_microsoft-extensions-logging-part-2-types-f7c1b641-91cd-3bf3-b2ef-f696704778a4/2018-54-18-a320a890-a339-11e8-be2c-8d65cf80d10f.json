Bonus points if you can use `ConfigureAwait(false)`, since that will schedule those short CPU-bound ops on thread pool threads in a (somewhat) even fashion.\r\n\r\nIf your CPU-bound ops are more intensive (or more parallelizable), then look into TPL Dataflow. You can create a \"flow\" or \"pipeline\" for your data to pass through, with a mixture of `async` and parallel stages.","date":"2018-08-18T22:54:18.357Z"}
