I have a couple of fundamental questions for which i cant seem to find a direct answer.\r\n1) When using Task.Run() for compute bound operations, why do ineed to use an await as in \"await Task.Run(myService.PredictStockMarketAsync())\". The Task.Run() is anyway going to be executed ona background thread and is blocking in nature because of its CPU bound work. Why use an await?\r\n2) When you mention cpu-bound work are you specifically talking about high cpu bound work like complex mathematical calculations. Even in methods that use naturally asynchronous code like getting data from a website, there are some work that needs to happen after the data is received, for ex fornatting the string data for presentation, which i believe involves sone CPU activity. Can you please clarify on the difference?\r\n\r\nThanks again for this series","date":"2022-08-30T03:52:29.970Z"}
