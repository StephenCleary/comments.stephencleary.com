In addition to this, it also has a custom-coded worker thread pool (we have used Task.Factory.StartNew to create these long running workers), which listens to a queue to pick the job and executes them. In each worker, the status of job being processed will be logged into database (simple insert queries).\r\n\r\nIn this application, we use Task.Run,  \r\n#1 - In all the notification subscribers. The handlers will be invoked using Task.Run.  \r\n#2 - In logger, to log the worker status into database.\r\n\r\nIs this a good practice?  \r\nAlso, I would like to understand the difference between using Task.Factory.StartNew and Task.Run in a web service. (basically in a typical web service like the one mentioned above)\r\n\r\nWe are experiencing some performance issues in this service. Initially all the tasks were invoke using Task.Factory.StartNew. After reading your blog posts, I have converted it to use Task.Run (expect the place where we created the worker).  \r\nBut I would like to understand how it functions behind the scenes in the context of a web service, to proceed further.\r\n\r\nPlease advise.\r\n\r\nThank you!","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-even-in-92009538-82a4-3754-9963-fbe116fda88e","replyTo":"","date":"2018-04-23T13:34:04Z","timestamp":1524490444}
