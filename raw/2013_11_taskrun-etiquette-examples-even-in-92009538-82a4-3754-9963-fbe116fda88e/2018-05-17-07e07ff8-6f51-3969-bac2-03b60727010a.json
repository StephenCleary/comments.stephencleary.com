That said, async does make some things simpler (e.g., \"do these 100 downloads concurrently and then retrieve all the results\"), so in some cases you may want to avoid blocking even if you know you're on a thread pool thread in a client-side app. (Blocking one thread is no big deal; blocking 100 is not so great).","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-even-in-92009538-82a4-3754-9963-fbe116fda88e","replyTo":"4266ec62-3b79-301c-9a34-71ff607830dd","date":"2018-05-17T02:08:33Z","timestamp":1526522913}
