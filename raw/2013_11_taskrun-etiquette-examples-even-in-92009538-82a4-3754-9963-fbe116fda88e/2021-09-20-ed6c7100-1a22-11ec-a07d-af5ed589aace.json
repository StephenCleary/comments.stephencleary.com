However, if the method could possibly be used from a web app, then the web app would want to call it directly (not using `Task.Run`). So if this is a general-purpose library, you would want to include the asynchronous code, since you don't know what kind of app your consumers may be using. Also, it's somewhat common these days for some APIs to *only* offer asynchronous calls.\r\n\r\nBut if this is your own code and will only be used in a GUI app and if there are synchronous APIs available, then you can certainly make it synchronous with no problems!","date":"2021-09-20T14:56:25.782Z"}
