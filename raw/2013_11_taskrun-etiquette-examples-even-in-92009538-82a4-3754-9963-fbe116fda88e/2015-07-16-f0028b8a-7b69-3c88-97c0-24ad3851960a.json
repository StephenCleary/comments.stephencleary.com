So to me it would be cleaner to have DataDiscCreator.CreateDisk just be synchronous, and then have BurnDataDiscExecute (in the UI layer) call \"await Task.Run(() => discCreator.CreateDisk(..));\". The primary point is to move the \"fake async\" part out of the potentially-reusable code (DataDiscCreator) and into the UI layer where it belongs.\r\n\r\nAs a secondary point, use Task.Run instead of Task.Factory.StartNew.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-even-in-92009538-82a4-3754-9963-fbe116fda88e","replyTo":"35f5343d-7fae-3555-9472-805644bb9456","date":"2015-07-16T18:15:11Z","timestamp":1437070511}
