The vast majority of the time, the TaskScheduler rule doesn't come into play, but it can catch you.\r\n\r\nIt's not necessarily the same thread - that's only true for UI threads.\r\n\r\nIn particular, ASP.NET (currently) has a SynchronizationContext that has all the \"current request\" data like HttpContext.Current, the currently-logged-in user, the requested page culture, etc. When an async method resumes, it will resume with all of that same \"current request\" data, but it can resume on a different thread.\r\n\r\nFor another more common example, the thread pool context comes into play when there isn't a SynchronizationContext *or* TaskScheduler. This is the normal case if you use async/await within a Task.Run (or any other code running on a thread pool thread). In this case, there is no context, so it works just as if you had specified ConfigureAwait(false) - that is, it will resume on any thread pool thread, which may or may not be the same one it was running on.","postId":"2013_11_taskrun-etiquette-examples-even-in-92009538-82a4-3754-9963-fbe116fda88e","replyTo":"c283aa43-841f-3c84-89a9-6814d2eee83b","date":"2016-02-05T13:59:12Z","timestamp":1454680752,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
