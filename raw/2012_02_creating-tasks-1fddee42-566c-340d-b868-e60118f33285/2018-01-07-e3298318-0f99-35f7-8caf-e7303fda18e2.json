That said, calling GetAwaiter (or OnCompleted) is an extremely fast operation, and it doesn't matter which thread they run on.\r\n\r\nThe question of \"which one should I use\" comes down to what kind of operation you're dealing with.\r\n\r\nIn your first example, you have an event firing off a Timer. This is similar to the way I/O works, or other events (including timers). This is a very natural fit for using tasks as events, so wrapping these events into a TaskCompletionSource is a natural approach.\r\n\r\nIn your second example, you have a Thread.Sleep. This is a synchronous operation (blocking its thread). So it is similar to the way CPU-bound algorithms work, or any kind of a blocking call. If you don't want to block the calling thread (e.g., the main UI thread), then a natural approach is to wrap it in Task.Run. Once they're wrapped into a task, they can be await'ed just like any other task.","postId":"2012_02_creating-tasks-1fddee42-566c-340d-b868-e60118f33285","replyTo":"38ffb00b-cd4e-34d9-8493-dfaead61e012","date":"2018-01-07T21:12:48Z","timestamp":1515359568,"authorUserId":"disqus:stephen_cleary"}
