Target platform; .NET framework on both Windows or ASP.NET. But the reason I wrote 'Quote 2' from one of your posts is to back-up the 'Quote 1' ==> Implementing 'Task.Run' in the other method is not a good idea.\r\n\r\n2. What I want to do is not a specific operation, but to understand which one is better from below two operations  \r\n A. In the main thread, a CPU-bound method is called. The method implements Task.Run. The result is displayed by Console.WriteLine inside method itself ==> You said, this is not a good idea\r\n\r\n B. In the main thread, a CPU-bound method is called. The method implements Task.Run. The result is returned to the main thread via TaskAwaiter and displayed by ConsoleWriteLine via OnCompleted event ==> Demonstrated in this post. You said, this is extremely fast.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm comparing these two cases. I expected one of below answers from you.  \r\n A. For Windows .NET case, both methods are okay and extremely fast. But for the ASP.NET, 'Method B' above is much efficient.\r\n\r\n B. Implementation of 'TaskAwaiter' on low level is different from just implementing Task.Run in the method. So using 'TaskAwaiter' in main thread + 'Task.Run' in method is much efficient than just using 'Task.Run' in method.\r\n\r\n C. Actually, both of them are same. There's no gain in using TaskAwaiter. But this is a syntax sugar.\r\n\r\nThanks again.","postId":"2012_02_creating-tasks-1fddee42-566c-340d-b868-e60118f33285","replyTo":"df9de61e-665b-3def-9d4c-24e5daa3a1b7","date":"2018-01-08T07:22:07Z","timestamp":1515396127,"authorUserId":"disqus:disqus_dyYQnhsWs6"}
