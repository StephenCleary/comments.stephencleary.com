All the rest of these guidelines assume the operation is synchronous.  \r\n2) On ASP.NET, never use Task.Run just to jump threads. It just makes your code less efficient for no benefit. If your Windows app is a service-style app (Console, Win32 service), then the same guideline applies to it as well.  \r\n3) If your Windows app is a UI app, and you want to move the operation off the UI thread, then use Task.Run.\r\n\r\nJust ignore TaskAwaiter. It doesn't change anything or help in any way, and I think it's just making this more confusing.","postId":"2012_02_creating-tasks-1fddee42-566c-340d-b868-e60118f33285","replyTo":"4c0a07bb-3a2e-326d-a7c8-dfc344c14aa0","date":"2018-01-08T13:30:35Z","timestamp":1515418235}
