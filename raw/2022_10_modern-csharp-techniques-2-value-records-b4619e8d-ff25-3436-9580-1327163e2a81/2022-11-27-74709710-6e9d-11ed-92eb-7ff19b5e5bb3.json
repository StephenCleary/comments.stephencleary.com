I don't like the fact that I can use with or the default constructor and have an invalid object. I'm unsure how to handle this other than verifying that its valid at the boundary and then using it within the domain without the need to check if its valid every time. Basically, how do I embrace the mostly valid state versus always valid state.\r\n\r\nOne question I have for your Age type is the range, does your domain care about the 0 to 100 or is it a 'technical' limit. Can this validation be outside the domain (via model binding, etc.) and you just use Age within your domain? It might be similar to name not being greater than 50 characters. Our domain usually doesn't care how long a name is, but our storage mechanism may care.","date":"2022-11-27T21:50:06.305Z"}
