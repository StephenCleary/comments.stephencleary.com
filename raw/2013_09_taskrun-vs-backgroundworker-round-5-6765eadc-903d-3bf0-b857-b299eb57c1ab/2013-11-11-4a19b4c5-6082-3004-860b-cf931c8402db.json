The caller constructs a value of Progress. Progress exposes the \"caller\" side of the API, and IProgress exposes the \"consumer\" side of the API.  \r\n\r\nSo the conversion of \"progressHandler\" to IProgress simulates the conversion that happens during the method call.","postId":"2013_09_taskrun-vs-backgroundworker-round-5-6765eadc-903d-3bf0-b857-b299eb57c1ab","replyTo":"","date":"2013-11-11T17:29:03Z","timestamp":1384190943}
