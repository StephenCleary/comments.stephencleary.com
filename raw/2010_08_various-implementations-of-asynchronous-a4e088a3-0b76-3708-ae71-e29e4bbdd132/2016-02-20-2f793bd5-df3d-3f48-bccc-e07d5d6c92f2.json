These days, I would recommend using Task.Run instead of BeginInvoke.\r\n\r\nIt's not easy to spin up parallel work using only async/await, but it's not prevented, either. So you can use Task.Run, or if you run async code in a thread pool context, you can have multiple async methods continuing in parallel.\r\n\r\nIn general, if you need to do parallel (multi-threaded, CPU-bound) work, then you have Parallel or TPL. If you need to do asynchronous (generally I/O-bound) work, then you have async/await. If you need to mix the two, look into TPL Dataflow.","postId":"2010_08_various-implementations-of-asynchronous-a4e088a3-0b76-3708-ae71-e29e4bbdd132","replyTo":"6ccd9f93-f0b3-3d3b-a658-e489316dc52e","date":"2016-02-20T19:55:35Z","timestamp":1455998135}
