It seems like BeginInvoke is really just an abstraction that queues onto the ThreadPool (as opposed to async/await, which if I read your other \"there is no thread\" post properly, only uses the ThreadPool for that response handle piece). In addition, it seems like you can use BeginInvoke to spin up a bunch of parallel work (assuming thread pool availability) that is not asynchronous, whereas with async/await, there is nothing parallel about what is being done.
