So it's hardly IDisposable's fault... If there is anything wrong with IDisposeable, it's what is written about it and tough about it... (This even comes from Microsoft them self who are more focused on what they wanted with the interface rather than what they managed to be capable of)... which overall has makes it all a huge mess.\r\n\r\nBut considering that the using statement can be useful in other scenarios as well. Then I wouldn't cling to strongly to these rules.\r\n\r\nOne could argue that it would be desired to unlock using for other interfaces, possibly user defined interfaces, but that is another talk.","postId":"2009_08_how-to-implement-idisposable-and-d34f3d33-4fe5-3bde-a6b4-27fed51b383d","replyTo":"","date":"2016-12-05T10:56:08Z","timestamp":1480935368,"authorUserId":"disqus:jens_melgaard"}
