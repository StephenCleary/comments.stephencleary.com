ReleaseComObject can be called from Dispose if your COM object is owned by that object.  \r\n\r\nCOM objects are considered managed resources (since the GC will deref them eventually).  \r\n\r\nI'm basing my assumptions on CBrumme's blog post, which may help you in your design: [http://blogs.msdn.com/b/cbr...](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/cbrumme/archive/2003/04/16/51355.aspx \"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/cbrumme/archive/2003/04/16/51355.aspx\")","postId":"2009_08_how-to-implement-idisposable-and-d34f3d33-4fe5-3bde-a6b4-27fed51b383d","replyTo":"","date":"2011-10-18T00:30:19Z","timestamp":1318897819,"authorUserId":""}
