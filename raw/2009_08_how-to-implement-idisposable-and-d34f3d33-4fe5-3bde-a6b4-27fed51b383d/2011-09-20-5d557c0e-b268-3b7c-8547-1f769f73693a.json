It is almost always, by the definition of exceptions, the wrong thing to do. If you catch an exception, it should be handled. The only case where it shouldn't is a case where exceptions can be thrown for things that aren't actually broken. (Thread.Sleep, for example, can throw a ThreadInterruptedException if someone calls thatThread.Interrupt(). But nothing's actually \"wrong\".) However, cases like that are not that common, and they're usually already handled by the code that needs to handle them. All you're really doing by swallowing exceptions is sweeping errors under the rug and making them that much harder to diagnose and fix.","postId":"2009_08_how-to-implement-idisposable-and-d34f3d33-4fe5-3bde-a6b4-27fed51b383d","replyTo":"","date":"2011-09-20T16:16:17Z","timestamp":1316535377,"authorUserId":""}
