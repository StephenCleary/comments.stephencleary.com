Threading has honestly never been my strong suit, and I'd love understand better some of the reasons why certain things should or should not be used.  \r\n\r\nThanks for sharing this!","postId":"2009_12_slides-from-nmnug-available-9d0af0fb-2119-3daf-a176-52a9af917f97","replyTo":"","date":"2009-12-04T02:35:33Z","timestamp":1259894133},{"_id":"4449275e-cc76-36bb-ab96-92a05569a0bb","authorName":"Stephen Cleary","authorEmailEncrypted":"","authorEmailMD5":"3db7b6e14d9da42751e4bab03bc4d034","authorUri":"https://stephencleary.com/","authorUserId":"","authorFallbackAvatar":"","message":"Yes.  \r\n\r\nThe best way to ask threading questions is on an MSDN forum. This gives you the chance to get responses from other threading experts, and also provides answers to other learners.  \r\n\r\nIf you want me to take a look at a particular question, go ahead and post it to an MSDN forum and then send me an email pointing me to it. (My email is in the upper right of my blog). Normally I monitor the forums, but the last month or so has been crazy. :)","postId":"2009_12_slides-from-nmnug-available-9d0af0fb-2119-3daf-a176-52a9af917f97","replyTo":"","date":"2009-12-04T18:49:07Z","timestamp":1259952547}]
