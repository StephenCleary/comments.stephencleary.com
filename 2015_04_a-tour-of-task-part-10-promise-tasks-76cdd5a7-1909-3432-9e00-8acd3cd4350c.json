The new methods *do* take a CancellationToken because technically, that's the right way to do it.\r\n\r\nThe CancellationToken is observable if that task is await'ed - it will throw an OperationCanceledException whose CancellationToken identifies which token caused the cancellation. The use case for this is rare but real: when calling an API that can be canceled different ways (e.g., a timeout or a user-requested cancellation), and if it's important to determine which one canceled it, then the caller can examine OperationCanceledException.CancellationToken. In most cases, just checking CT.IsCancellationRequested on both CTs would be sufficient, but sometimes it's necessary to know which one *actually cancelled* the operation and just using IsCancellationRequested would cause race conditions (e.g., if the user caused the cancellation but then the timeout expired before the CT checks).\r\n\r\nIt's also just cleaner and nicer to pass a CancellationToken because that's the standard cancellation semantics.\r\n\r\nI think the article you referenced is a bit confusing:  \r\n- The ArgumentOutOfRange exception is thrown directly. That is, if you pass an uncanceled CT into Task.FromCanceled, the exception is *not* placed on the task. It's a usage error - a boneheaded exception, as Eric Lippert calls it - and is thrown immediately and directly from Task.FromCanceled. Code should never call Task.FromCanceled with an uncanceled CT. That exception indicates a bug in the calling code.  \r\n- You would (almost) always pass in a local CancellationToken. You'd (almost) never want to pass in \"new CancellationToken(true)\". If you find yourself in this situation, it means you're writing an asynchronous API that can produce canceled tasks but does not provide a way to cancel them. That goes against the common semantics - a more appropriate exception would almost certainly be better than OperationCanceledException in that case.\r\n\r\nI'm hesitating using \"always\" and \"never\" in that last point, but honestly, I can't think of a single situation where you would ever *want* to pass \"new CancellationToken(true)\".","postId":"2015_04_a-tour-of-task-part-10-promise-tasks-76cdd5a7-1909-3432-9e00-8acd3cd4350c","replyTo":"4bbc17a8-d527-3b60-8856-f32f0cdece00","date":"2016-08-20T01:05:47Z","timestamp":1471655147},{"_id":"76e7adce-41a6-372c-84df-27b3c2147ae6","authorName":"JullioSanntos","authorEmailEncrypted":"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","authorEmailMD5":"bfbe92bb4f239103a9c038bf4d0572bc","authorUri":"","authorUserId":"disqus:JullioSanntos","authorFallbackAvatar":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/JullioSanntos.jpg","message":"Hi Stephen, I was wondering what are your recommendations to create a Class type that switches the mouse's cursor to a busy/waiting image when waiting an array of Promise Tasks. For instance, an async button click handler starts a Promise Task that will take an undetermined time to complete, therefore multiple clicks will create multiple concurrent Tasks, potentially.   \r\nI'd like to have a generic Cursor singleton that indicates when there is one or more Tasks running and switch back to the original image when none are running. My initial thoughts are Task.WhenAll and a Queue collection to cancel/adjust the WhenAll if a new task is summoned or an existing one cancelled but I don't know how to get the Task object of a Promise Task for searching the Queue.   \r\nI can provide a proof-of-concept C# project, if necessary. Your thoughts, please.\r\n\r\nI neglected to mention that, naturally, the async code that is awaiting the Task could add/remove whatever object into a collection to indicate concurrency (or just a counter of concurrent Tasks) but that throws the responsibility of resetting the cursor Wait status to the developer, a dangerous thing and the first step on creating a cursor that never changes its status back, specially when an exception is thrown.  \r\nI guess I miss the elegance of a Cursor object that relied entirely on one single component, the dispatcher thread.
